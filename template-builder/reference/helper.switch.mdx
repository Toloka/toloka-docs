# helper.switch

A switch-case construction. Checks various conditions sequentially and executes the code from the `result` property when the corresponding condition is true.

You can use it to perform an action or display an additional interface element only when a certain condition is met.

<Button themeColor="light" view="default" size="l" type="link" url="https://ya.cc/t/RcgC_nQJ3tz3j4">View example</Button>

This helper is similar to a series of [If...Then...Else](/docs-new/template-builder/reference/helper.if) logical expressions, so it is useful if there are more than two conditions for sequential verification. If you need to check one or two conditions, use the [helper.if](/docs-new/template-builder/reference/helper.if) component.

How the helper works:

1. The helper checks _(conditions)_ from the array of `cases` objects, starting from the first one.
2. If the condition is true (returns `true`), the helper returns the result (block of code) specified in the `result` property for the `condition` object in the `cases` array. **The helper quits and subsequent conditions are not checked.**
3. If the condition is false (returns `false`), the helper checks the subsequent condition.
4. If all conditions are false as a result of all checks, the helper returns the value specified in the `default` property (if it is not defined, the helper returns nothing).
