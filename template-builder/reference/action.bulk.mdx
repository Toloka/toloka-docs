# action.bulk

Use this component to call multiple actions at the same time, like to show more than one notification when a button is clicked.

<Button themeColor="light" view="default" size="l" type="link" url="https://ya.cc/t/jH6BvDpE3twfMn">View example</Button>

Actions are invoked in the order in which they are listed. This means that if two actions write a value to the same variable, the variable will always have the second value.
