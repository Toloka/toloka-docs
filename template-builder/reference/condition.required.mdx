# condition.required

Checks that the field which must contain the data is present in the response. This way you can get a Toloker to answer all the required questions.

If used inside the `validation` property, you can omit the `data` property and the same property will be used from the parent component [field](/docs-new/template-builder/reference/fields) (the one that contains the `condition.required` component).
