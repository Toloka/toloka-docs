# Configure keyboard shortcuts

Add keyboard shortcuts for the frequently used interface elements. This will help Tolokers because keyboard combinations are somewhat faster than mouse clicks.

In [Toloka](https://toloka.ai/), shortcuts are particularly helpful because Tolokers will do your tasks faster and you can pay less for them. If your project has a low score for “Interface usability“, adding shortcuts will help improve the rating.

## Shortcut features {#hotkeys-features}

Shortcuts are digits or letters shown next to buttons. Shortcuts help Tolokers do an action by pressing a key.

A shortcut is always added to a button if they do the same thing.

Keyboard shortcuts are independent of the interface. They work even if they are not displayed, like if you set up a shortcut without setting up a button.

Some components provide additional ways for setting up shortcuts. For example, the [field.image-annotation](/docs/template-builder/reference/field.image-annotation) component has its own [plugin](/docs/template-builder/reference/plugin.field.image-annotation.hotkeys).

## How to configure shortcuts {#set-hotkeys}

Use a separate plugin to configure shortcuts: [plugin.hotkeys](/docs/template-builder/reference/plugin.hotkeys). Use this plugin to assign keys to actions. Plugins are added to the `plugins` array in the configuration root.

```json
{
  "type": "plugin.hotkeys",
    "p": {
     "type": "action.play-pause",
     "view": {
       "$ref": "view.items.0"
    }
  }
}
```

In this example, pressing **P** triggers the [action.play-pause](/docs/template-builder/reference/action.play-pause) action. It starts or pauses playback in the player. The player is specified in the `view` property by using the [$ref](/docs/template-builder/best-practices/reuse) structure, which links to another place in the configuration.

<Button themeColor="light" view="default" size="l" type="link" url="https://ya.cc/t/Xgp6T_QW3ttAao">View example</Button>

<Note mode="tip" title="Tip">

Mind the keyboard layout when setting up shortcuts: if you choose a character that looks similar in the Cyrillic and Latin layouts, it might confuse Tolokers.

## Radio buttons and checkboxes {#radio-check}

Use the [action.set](/docs/template-builder/reference/action.set) component to set up shortcuts for radio buttons. For checkboxes, use [action.toggle](/docs/template-builder/reference/action.toggle). Assign shortcuts to actions that your radio buttons or checkboxes do.

<Button themeColor="light" view="default" size="l" type="link" url="https://ya.cc/t/I1QHLeKP3ttEqg">View example</Button>

## Reusing shortcuts {#reuse}

You can [reuse](/docs/template-builder/best-practices/reuse) shortcuts just like any other code fragments. To do this, use the structure `{ "$ref": "path.to.element" }`. Reuse is helpful when you need to insert the same shortcuts in multiple places in your code.

<Button themeColor="light" view="default" size="l" type="link" url="https://ya.cc/t/xeczgrzA3ttEr8">View example</Button>

<Note mode="tip" title="Tip">

Put your reused code into `vars` so that you don't have to change the path in the `$ref` property when you change the configuration.

</Note>

## Multiple actions {#bulk-actions}

For a Toloker to trigger multiple actions by pressing a button, add the [action.bulk](/docs/template-builder/reference/action.bulk) component. For example, you can use it to show multiple notifications.

<Button themeColor="light" view="default" size="l" type="link" url="https://ya.cc/t/8zMd_Hrb3ttErs">View example</Button>

## Conditions in shortcuts {#if-switch}

If you use a condition ([helper.if](/docs/template-builder/reference/helper.if) or [helper.switch](/docs/template-builder/reference/helper.switch)), also add it to the shortcut to ensure consistency.

If you set up a shortcut without a condition, the shortcut will still work, but won't be visualized. This might cause errors.

Here is an example of an error. In this example, if Tolokers respond **Yes**, they see another question. But they can use a keyboard shortcut to respond to it, even if it's not shown in the interface.

## Troubleshooting {#troubleshooting}

To display a shortcut in the interface, set the shortcut to the same [action](/docs/template-builder/reference/actions) that is performed when the button is clicked.

Assign an action to the component if you haven't yet:
- [action.set](/docs/template-builder/reference/action.set) for radio buttons.
- [action.toggle](/docs/template-builder/reference/action.toggle) for checkboxes.
- [action.play-pause](/docs/template-builder/reference/action.play-pause) for playback control.
- [action.open-close](/docs/template-builder/reference/action.open-close) to zoom in on images.

You can see the full list of actions in [List of actions](/docs/template-builder/reference/actions).

Keep in mind the following:

- The data types for actions must be the same. For example, in the following case the shortcut works but is not displayed: clicking on the button saves the `“true”` string to the results, and the Boolean value `true` is defined for the shortcut.
- If multiple actions are triggered when the button is clicked ([action.bulk](/docs/template-builder/reference/action.bulk)), the sequence of these actions for the shortcut must be the same.
- If you use a conditional operator to select an action, such as [helper.if](/docs/template-builder/reference/helper.if), the same conditional operator (**helper.if**) must be called under the same rules when the shortcut key is pressed.
