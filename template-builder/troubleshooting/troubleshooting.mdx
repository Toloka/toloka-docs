# Troubleshooting

## Video and audio {#media}

<Cut title="Video or audio is not playing">

Errors may occur when playing back the linked media files. The preview window shows the error causes. The table below describes how to troubleshoot errors.

**Error message**|**Cause and fix**
----- | -----
Playback was interrupted|**Cause:** Getting and downloading the media file has been interrupted by a Toloker.<br/><br/>**How to fix:** Refresh the page.
Can't download video/audio due to network problems|**Cause:** The media file can't be downloaded because the network connection is down or unstable.<br/><br/>**How to fix:** Check the network connection and refresh the page.
The format is not supported by your device|**Cause:** An attempt to decode the media file has failed.<br/><br/>This might happen if the media file format mismatches the device codec or the file is damaged.<br/><br/><TroubleshootingTable2/>
Video/audio file download failure or non-video file hosted at the URL| <TroubleshootingTable1/>

</Cut>

## Shortcuts {#hotkey}

<Cut title="A shortcut is not displayed">

To display a shortcut in the interface, set the shortcut to the same [action](/docs-new/template-builder/reference/actions) that is performed when the button is clicked.

Assign an action to the component if you haven't yet:

- [action.set](/docs-new/template-builder/reference/action.set) for radio buttons.
- [action.toggle](/docs-new/template-builder/reference/action.toggle) for checkboxes.
- [action.play-pause](/docs-new/template-builder/reference/action.play-pause) for playback control.
- [action.open-close](/docs-new/template-builder/reference/action.open-close) to zoom in on images.

You can see the full list of actions in [List of actions](/docs-new/template-builder/reference/actions).

Keep in mind the following:

- The data types for actions must be the same. For example, in the following case the shortcut works but is not displayed: clicking on the button saves the `“true”` string to the results, and the Boolean value `true` is defined for the shortcut.
- If multiple actions are triggered when the button is clicked ([action.bulk](/docs-new/template-builder/reference/action.bulk)), the sequence of these actions for the shortcut must be the same.
- If you use a conditional operator to select an action, such as [helper.if](/docs-new/template-builder/reference/helper.if), the same conditional operator (**helper.if**) must be called under the same rules when the shortcut key is pressed.
