The [field.button-radio-group](/docs/template-builder/reference/field.button-radio-group) component is displayed as solid buttons. It's better to use these buttons if the question has 2â€“4 short answer options.

  If there are more answer options, or they are long, it's better to use [field.radio-group](/docs/template-builder/reference/field.radio-group), as in the example.

  <Button themeColor="light" view="default" size="l" type="link" url="https://ya.cc/t/BQPuzqRh3ttFYX">View example</Button>
