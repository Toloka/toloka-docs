The [field.button-radio-group](/docs-new/template-builder/reference/field.button-radio-group) component is displayed as solid buttons. It's better to use these buttons if the question has 2–4 short answer options.

  If there are more answer options, or they are long, it's better to use [field.radio-group](/docs-new/template-builder/reference/field.radio-group), as in the example.
