Allows you to hide data from a Toloker. If this is not done, Tolokers can get the field value programmatically. You can configure this parameter in JSON mode.

For example, you can hide the `assigment_id` identifier you will need when reviewing assignments in a separate project.

<Cut title="Reviewing assignments">

A [pool](/docs-new/glossary#pool) setting that allows you to check responses so you don't have to pay for poorly completed tasks.

</Cut>

By default, the field is visible â€” `false`.

<Note mode="warning" title="Warning">

Hidden fields are not available in the task interface, even through JS or the template code in the constructor.
