If you use at least two types of areas in your task, list the shortcuts for them in the array of the `labels` property, separating them with commas. They will be assigned to the area selection buttons in the order they are displayed.

```json
{
    "type": "plugin.field.image-annotation.hotkeys",
    "labels": [
        "1",
        "2"
    ]
}
```

  <Button themeColor="light" view="default" size="l" type="link" url="https://ya.cc/t/5tABGn7W3ttFFX">View example</Button>
