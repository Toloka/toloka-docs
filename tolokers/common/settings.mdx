   #### Field tasks

   You can complete field tasks without permanent internet connection. You only need the internet to choose and reserve tasks and send responses.

   - Wi-Fi only — Turn on **Submit over Wi-Fi only**.

   This option saves cellular data. Your responses are stored on your device and are submitted as soon as Wi-Fi is available.

   <Note mode="note" title="Note">

   You need to make sure your responses are submitted before the task time expires.

   </Note>

   - Wi-Fi or mobile network — Turn off **Submit over Wi-Fi only**.

   This option means you can send responses immediately after you complete tasks, as soon as you are connected to the internet.

   #### Non-field tasks

   Non-field tasks require a constant internet connection.

   - Wi-Fi only — Turn on **Submit over Wi-Fi only**.

   - Wi-Fi or mobile network — Turn off **Submit over Wi-Fi only**.
