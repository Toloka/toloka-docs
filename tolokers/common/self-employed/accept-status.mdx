# After the form is reviewed

<Note mode="restriction" title="Alert">

Only citizens of Russia can be self-employed. Individual entrepreneurs can't become self-employed if they pay taxes under the simplified taxation system. If you want to be self-employed and maintain the status of an individual entrepreneur, switch to a different tax regime. [More about tax statuses](https://www.nalog.ru/create_business/ul/in_progress/taxation_type_choice/).

Self-employed individuals can withdraw funds to [YooMoney](/docs-new/tolokers/pay/yoomoney) and via [FPS](/docs-new/tolokers/pay/sbp).

</Note>

## Before you start {#before-form}

If you are not self-employed, register with the [My Taxes](https://npd.nalog.ru/app/) system.

Once registered, you become self-employed and can interact with tax authorities using the My Taxes mobile app or the [taxpayer account](https://lknpd.nalog.ru/auth/login).
