# Restoring access

If you received a letter saying that your account in [Toloka] (http://toloka.yandex.com/) is blocked and suggesting that you restore your access by proving your identity, fill in the form.

To confirm your identity, attach a photo of yourself holding one of the following documents:
- internal passport
- international passport
- driver's license
- ID card, if used in your country
   The first and last name, photo, and date of birth should be clearly visible in the document.
