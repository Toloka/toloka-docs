<Cut title="I can't register because my phone number is already linked to another account">

Your phone number can only be linked to one [Toloka](http://toloka.yandex.com/) account at a time. Most likely, you already registered in the system under a different username.

<Cut title="Account blocked">

Toloka has an antifraud monitoring system. It automatically checks user behavior and blocks suspicious accounts. In different cases, the ban may be caused by different reasons.

Tips on how to avoid getting blocked are described under [How to be a successful Toloker](/docs-new/tolokers/tasks).
After blocking, you will receive two emails:
1. Automatic notification about blocking.
1. The message informs you why the account is blocked and if it is possible to unblock it.

If it is possible to unblock it, follow the steps in the email.

</Cut>

<Cut title="Questions about a profile">

<Cut title="Why don't I see all my skills in my profile?">

Not all skills are displayed in your profile. It depends on the skill settings and the type of task.

</Cut>

<Cut title="Can several Tolokers use the same account?">

No. Transferring your account to another person is a violation of Section 5.2 of the [User Agreement](https://toloka.ai/tolokers/legal/user-agreement/).

</Cut>

<Cut title="What are awards for?">

Awards can help you track your achievements and discover more Toloka features.

</Cut>

<Cut title="When are awards given?">

Awards are given within 24 hours after you achieve the desired result. If the award doesn't appear in your profile within a few days, please contact the Toloka support service.

</Cut>

</Cut>

<Cut title="Questions about tasks">

<Cut title="How do I choose a task?">

The list of tasks shows the tasks available to you at the moment. Each of them has a short description and price. Choose a task and complete it.

</Cut>

<Cut title="What are free tasks for?">

Training tasks are generally not paid for. They are used to teach Tolokers to perform a particular kind of task and select those who show the best results. You get access to the main, paid task only after you successfully complete the training.

</Cut>

<Cut title="Low task cost">

The cost of the task directly depends on its complexity and how much time it takes to complete it. Simple tasks that don't require special skills and a lot of time cost less than more complex ones. But the better you cope with them, the higher their cost will be and the more chances there are to get a reward from the requester.

</Cut>

<Cut title="Maximum and average earnings">

The maximum earnings displayed in the task card show how much three of the most active Tolokers earn on average per day.
The average earnings displayed in the task card show how much you can earn on the task per hour on average.

</Cut>

<Cut title="How do I remove a reservation from a task??">

After the expiration of the allotted period, the reservation is automatically removed and the tasks return to the main page. You can remove the reservation manually. To do this, go to the task, click **←** and select {% if platform=="android" or platform=="web" %}**Refuse**{% elsif platform == 'ios' %}**Refuse**{% endif %}. The option to reserve tasks is provided for Tolokers' convenience. If for some reason you can't complete the tasks you have reserved, it doesn't affect the availability of other tasks or your performance in [Toloka](http://toloka.yandex.com/).

</Cut>

<Cut title="Questions about the content of tasks">

<Cut title="The task contains adult content">

According to the [User Agreement](https://toloka.ai/tolokers/legal/user-agreement/), tasks in Toloka may contain "adult" (including pornographic) content. Your actions in [Toloka](http://toloka.yandex.com/) that have to do with evaluating "adult content" don't violate the law. The Toloka service operates in accordance with the legislation of the Swiss Confederation and is aimed, among other things, at identifying materials of an offensive or pornographic nature. If this type of material is unacceptable to you, turn off the **I agree to perform tasks that contain adult content** option in the {% if platform == 'web' %}[profile](http://toloka.yandex.com/profile){% else %}profile{% endif %}.

</Cut>

<Cut title="The task requires recording a video or sending a photo">

Tasks in which Tolokers are asked to record a video or audio or take a photo are not prohibited in [Toloka](http://toloka.yandex.com/). If for some reason you don't want to complete this type of task, select another task from the list of available tasks.

</Cut>

<Cut title="The task requires recording a video or sending a photo">

Tasks in which Tolokers are asked to record a video or audio or take a photo are not prohibited in [Toloka](http://toloka.yandex.com/). If for some reason you don't want to complete this type of task, select another task from the list of available tasks.

</Cut>

<Cut title="The task contains a virus">

Requesters check their tasks before posting and try to make sure they don't contain malicious links. The virus can only appear if the content of the site you access from the task has changed after the task was posted. According to Section 4.7 of the [User Agreement](https://toloka.ai/tolokers/legal/user-agreement/), Toloka does not guarantee that tasks won't contain viruses and other malicious components. When completing tasks, the Toloker is solely responsible for the consequences of using the Toloka platform, including the damage that may be caused to software or hardware. If you encounter an infected site, notify the author of the task immediately.

<Note mode="tip" title="Tip">

Install antivirus software to prevent threats. This will be useful not only for completing tasks in [Toloka](http://toloka.yandex.com/) but also for visiting other sites.

</Note>

</Cut>

<Cut title="The task is in an unfamiliar language">

If you encounter tasks in an unfamiliar language, don't complete them.

</Cut>

</Cut>

<Cut title="Questions about a particular task">

Tasks are posted and checked by requesters. If you have a question about the completion of a particular task, contact the requester directly. To do this, find the task in the **Available**, **Reserved**, or **Done** section, open the task, click on the three dots in the upper-right corner, and select **Contact requester**.

<Cut title="Incorrect actions by the requester">

If you receive spam, or if someone tries to obtain your contact information or suggests installing any programs, [write to the support service](/docs-new/tolokers/support#contact).

<Note mode="note" title="Note">

Please don't send duplicate requests or ask for a faster response. The support service reviews all incoming requests. You will receive a reply within a few days.

</Note>

</Cut>

</Cut>

<Cut title="Questions about field tasks">

<Cut title="Can a task be rejected if a person or a car license plate number is in the shot?">

When requesters review tasks, they primarily check whether they are completed according to the instructions. However, according to Section 3.5 of the [User Agreement](https://toloka.ai/tolokers/legal/user-agreement/), you can't submit photos or videos of third parties or car license plates. Therefore, it doesn't matter whether the requester accepts the task or not. Your account might still be blocked for violation of the User Agreement, and you won't be able to withdraw money from Toloka (Section 8.5.3). Therefore, carefully check the photos and videos you're submitting for whether they contain vehicle number plates or other people's faces.
If the task asks you to take photos of strangers or car license plates, don't complete it and contact the Toloka support service. We will check the task, suspend it, or ask the requester to make changes to it so that the task complies with [Toloka](http://toloka.yandex.com/) rules.

</Cut>

<Cut title="Is it legal to take photos of organizations?">

According to the law, you are allowed to take photos on the street and in stores and transfer this information to third parties.

</Cut>

<Cut title="I want to make a badge with the Yandex logo to complete field tasks">

According to Section 5.8 of the [User Agreement](https://toloka.ai/tolokers/legal/user-agreement/), you work for Yandex as an independent contractor. Therefore, you can't use the logo, badge, or another ID that indicates your professional affiliation with Yandex or [Toloka](http://toloka.yandex.com/).

</Cut>

<Cut title="Why do I need to take photos in field tasks?">

The photos you take help improve map services and make online maps and directories more complete, useful, and up-to-date.

</Cut>

<Cut title="What do I do if the employees of organizations ask questions or don't allow me to take photos?">

If the employees of organizations ask you what you're collecting information for, explain that you're completing a task on the [Toloka](http://toloka.yandex.com/) platform. Your goal is to verify information about a business's presence at a certain address and its working hours. The accuracy and reliability of this information is in the interests of the organization itself, because it will be published in directories and on online maps. If the employees of organizations tell you that you're filming illegally, explain that you're not collecting any personally identifiable information such as people's faces and car license plate numbers. All photos will be further processed according to all applicable privacy laws. If the employees of organizations don't allow you to enter the building and take photos, try to politely explain the legality of your actions. If this doesn't help, don't get into a conflict, and refuse the task.

</Cut>

<Cut title="I can't complete a task in a remote place">

If you can't complete the task according to the instructions, refuse it.

</Cut>

<Cut title="There are no field tasks">

The availability of field tasks in specific cities depends on a number of factors: the needs of requesters, the epidemiological situation in the region, and so on. If there are currently no field tasks in your city, it means that requesters have suspended their placement for some reason. Check the map from time to time. You'll see the tasks when they appear.

</Cut>

</Cut>

<Cut title="I want to take a certain type of task, but it's not in the list anymore">

If the task you liked is no longer displayed, it may have already been completed or you don't meet the selection criteria set by the requester. While this task is absent, you can take other ones. The desired tasks may appear again later.

</Cut>

<Cut title="Can I complete tasks in a foreign language?">

Yes, if you are fluent enough in it.

</Cut>

<Cut title="What should I do if I received a task that I do not want to complete?">

If you don't want to complete a task from the list, don't start doing it. If you started a task, but you can't or don't want to complete the page that opens, go to the next one (use the {% if platform=="web" %}**Skip**{% elsif platform=="android" %}**Skip**{% elsif platform=="ios" %}**Skip**{% endif %}) button. Only fully completed tasks are paid for.

If you no longer want to complete this task, use the **Exit** button.

</Cut>

<Cut title="How do I stop task completion correctly if I decided to take a break?">

Click the **Exit** button.

If you answered all the questions on the page, click the **Send** button. When a new page loads, click **Exit**.

</Cut>

<Cut title="There are no tasks in the list">

This happens because of the filters you set. Sometimes, Tolokers set up filters and then forget to disable them.
Make sure that:
- You chose at least one requester and at least one task category in the {% if platform=="web" %}[task list](/docs-new/tolokers/task-select){% elsif platform=="android" or platform=="ios"%}task list{% endif %}.
- You specified the correct language in the {% if platform=="web" %}[profile](http://toloka.yandex.com/profile){% elsif platform=="android" or platform=="ios"%}profile{% endif %}.
- You linked your phone number to your [Yandex ID](https://passport.yandex.com/profile/phones).
- You are not connected via a server located in Switzerland (this may happen if you are using an [anonymizer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anonymizer), [VPN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_network) or [proxy server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_server)).

<Note mode="note" title="Note">

If you are willing to complete tasks that are marked 18+, check that the **I agree to perform tasks that contain adult content** option is turned on in your {% if platform=="web" %}[profile](http://toloka.yandex.com/profile){% elsif platform=="android" or platform=="ios" %}profile{% endif %}.

</Note>

If the problem persists, contact the [support service](/docs-new/tolokers/support#contact) and attach:

- A screenshot of your {% if platform=="android" or platform=="ios" %}profile{% elsif platform=="web" %}[profile](http://toloka.yandex.com/profile){% endif %} in Toloka.
- A screenshot of the [Phone numbers](https://passport.yandex.com/profile/phones) page.
