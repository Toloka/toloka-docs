# Tasks under review

Some tasks are reviewed for longer than others. The requester can reject a task if it isn't completed according to the instructions. Rejected tasks are not paid for.

## How long does the review take? {#deadline}

The review may take several days. The review period is specified in the **Under review until** field on **History**. All tasks are reviewed within the specified time frame or less.

## How do I get the results? {#result}

{% if platform == "web" %}
The history of completed tasks is available on the [Profile → History](https://toloka.yandex.com/profile/history) page.
{% endif %}.

{% if platform == "android" or platform == "ios" %}
To view your results, go to the {% if platform == "android" %}**Done**{% elsif platform == "ios" %}**My tasks → Done**{% endif %} page.

There you can view the full history of completed tasks (total earnings and the number of accepted and rejected tasks), as well as statistics for the day. To view statistics, click the button with the number of completed tasks next to the date.
{% endif %}

If your task is rejected, you can't complete it again. You can [challenge the review result](#appeal).

## When are the accepted tasks paid for? {#pay}

Don't send repeated requests or ask for a faster response. This will just move your request to the end of the queue, since messages are automatically sorted by time received.
