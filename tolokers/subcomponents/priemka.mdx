# Tasks under review

Some tasks are reviewed for longer than others. The requester can reject a task if it isn't completed according to the instructions. Rejected tasks are not paid for.

## How long does the review take? {#deadline}

The review may take several days. The review period is specified in the **Under review until** field on **History**. All tasks are reviewed within the specified time frame or less.

## How do I get the results? {#result}

<If condition={props.platform == "web"}>
The history of completed tasks is available on the [Profile → History](https://toloka.yandex.com/profile/history) page.

To view your results, go to the <If condition={props.platform == "android"}>**Done**</If><If condition={props.platform == "ios"}>**My tasks → Done**</If> page.
