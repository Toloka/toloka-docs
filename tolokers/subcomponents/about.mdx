# About the app

[Toloka](http://toloka.yandex.com/) is a crowdsourcing platform that helps process large amounts of data by distributing tasks to a large pool of annotators (Tolokers).

Requesters post tasks and set a price, while Tolokers choose tasks, [complete](/docs-new/tolokers/tasks) them, and earn [money](/docs-new/tolokers/priemka#pay).

There are different types of tasks available:

- Field tasks. You get a point on the map that you need to go to and, for example, find an organization (such as a cafe or store), find their business hours, or take a photo.

- Regular tasks. You don't need to go anywhere to complete them.

Completed tasks are [checked](/docs-new/tolokers/priemka) by the requester. The results are used to evaluate your [skills](/docs-new/tolokers/skills).

The prices are set by requesters. You can [withdraw funds](/docs-new/tolokers/pay/about) in different ways, depending on your country.
