**Tom** | Tom provides his real personal data on all online services he uses. He sees no point in deceiving anyone. When registering in Toloka, he provided his passport details correctly and has been successfully earning money for several years. | Tom knows that according to the [User Agreement](https://toloka.ai/tolokers/legal/user-agreement/), he can have only one Toloker account in Toloka. He registered one account and successfully uses it both on the website and in the mobile app. He safeguards the security of his username and password and doesn't give access to his account to anyone. | Tom believes in earning an honest living. So he tries to be attentive, carefully study the instructions, and complete tasks correctly. No wonder he has high skill levels in a variety of tasks. He has access to the most difficult and well-paid tasks and gets rewards. After a week of using Toloka, Tom tells his friends about Toloka, shares his referral link, and helps them find their way around the platform. But he remembers that all data in Toloka is confidential and doesn't share screenshots of tasks with friends or post them in social networks. His friends successfully complete tasks and increase his earnings. |  believes that any way to make money is good and distributes his [referral link](/docs-new/tolokers/referal) through viral emails.  also makes videos of how he completes training and posts screenshots of completed tasks in social networks. Moderators noticed this, excluded him from the referral program, and blocked his access to Toloka for disclosing confidential information. Now he can't make his own money or get a percentage of his friends earnings.

## What not to do in Toloka {#donot}

We make sure that Tolokers follow the rules of the platform, so we check the information they provide.

Toloka has an antifraud system for monitoring and preventing fraudulent behavior. It monitors Toloker behavior and blocks suspicious accounts. In different cases, the ban may be caused by different reasons, and we are not always able to remove it. Sometimes, the account may be blocked again after unblocking.

So do not:

- Use the platform if you are under 18.
- Provide invalid data during registration or in your profile.
- Use multiple accounts.
- Use scripts or bots or try to earn dishonestly.
- Complete tasks poorly.
- Make frequent mistakes when entering captchas, enter them carelessly, or skip them.

## What to do if you are banned {#ifbanned}

<Note mode="note" title="Note">

If your account is blocked, you will receive two messages: an automatic notification about the ban and a message from the administrator explaining the reason for the ban and what you can do. Usually, you need to fill out a form and provide documents or a selfie.

</Note>

1. Fill out the feedback form by clicking on the link in the administrator's message.

1. Meet the support requirements. Provide a document to confirm your identity if you are asked to do so. The pictures should be clear, and your first and last name, date of birth, and photo should be clearly visible in the document. Make sure that the data in the photo is readable before submitting the form.

1. Wait for the administrator's decision. Usually it takes one to several days to check the data.

If you're banned, it's not necessarily permanent. For example, if you often make mistakes when entering captchas, you may be blocked and asked to confirm that you are a real person and not a robot. You will most likely be unblocked the first time. But if you continue to make mistakes when entering captchas, you may lose access to tasks.
