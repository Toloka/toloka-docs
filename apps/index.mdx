# About

Bespoke solutions are useful if you need to quickly solve a problem and don't want to spend time on running a project on the platform itself.

Select the problem to solve, fill out an application form for creating a project, and upload your data: the service will configure the project for you, create a task interface, and find performers. All you have to do is run your project and get the labeling results.
