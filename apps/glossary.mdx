# Terms and definitions

<Definition title="Batch for labeling">

A batch of data that you send for labeling at a time. The batch consists of task items.

</Definition>

<Definition title="Bespoke project">

A bespoke project is based on a ready-made solution with the parameters that you specified. The interface and quality controls are pre-configured, decomposition is already done, and everything is ready to use: all you need is to upload task items to batches and send them for labeling.

</Definition>

<Definition title="Bespoke solution">

A bespoke solution is an example of a standard task that you can solve using Toloka. Unlike [self-service project](../../guide/concepts/overview.md#project) templates, you don't have to set up everything yourself.

</Definition>

<Definition title="Task item">

A task item is a labeling unit &mdash; in other words, data uploaded to a batch. The batch consists of task items, and the project consists of batches.

</Definition>

<Definition title="TSV file">

TSV (tab-separated values) is a text file format, in which data is separated by a tab, and lines are separated by a newline symbol.
