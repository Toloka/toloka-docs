# What tasks can't be placed in Toloka?

Toloka **isn't intended** for tasks that could harm performers, other requesters, or the Toloka platform. Your account may get blocked for posting such tasks.

## Guidelines for tasks

#### You can't post tasks that:

1. **Advertise and promote websites, products, or services,** involve any type of fraud related to advertising, reviews, clicks, ratings, and so on. In a task, don't ask performers to:

  - Register on websites, in apps, or on social media and use your referral link. If the performer needs to have an account on a particular social media platform or a website to complete the task, indicate this in the task or give them access (if this is allowed by the terms of use and privacy policy).

  - View ads on external sites. However, you can put your own advertising materials in tasks for performers to evaluate. For example, you can ask performers to compare two versions of a banner ad.

  - Subscribe to newsletters, order products or services, or fill out feedback forms.

  - Post, distribute, or evaluate posts and comments on social media or websites, participate in polls and surveys, or sign petitions. However, you can conduct surveys and research in Toloka.

  - Create and send out any kind of spam, distribute flyers, or make advertising calls.

  - Write and/or edit reviews of products, services, or organizations and/or post them on websites or social media platforms. But you can ask performers to moderate and evaluate reviews.

1. **Disclose the personal data** of the performer or a third party. Don't post tasks that:

  - Allow the requester or third parties to access the performer's account in Toloka.

  - Request data that can be used to identify the performer (for example, their phone number, email address, first and last name, place of residence, or bank card details).

  - Make performers take pictures or videos of people in the street, cars, and other vehicles with license plates. Such tasks are prohibited by the [User Agreement](https://toloka.ai/tolokers/legal/user-agreement). Mention this in the instructions for performers. If you receive these types of photos or videos in responses, don't use them. However, you can ask performers to take a selfie or a video of themselves.

1. **Could harm the performer, other requesters, or the Toloka platform.** Don't post tasks if they:

  - Involve illegal activities or creating illegal materials. Please note that Toloka has performers all over the world. The terms of the task and its materials must not violate the laws of their respective countries.

  - Are offensive or violate ethical and moral norms.

  - Encourage downloading or installing software, including malware, on performers' devices. If special software is needed to complete your task, contact support.

  - Could cause moral or material harm to performers or mislead them.

  - Harm the Toloka platform, its reputation, business, infrastructure, data, and more.

1. **Serve for recruiting** or assigning tasks to people who work for the requester. Don't make performers do work outside the platform and don't post tasks for your employees.

1. **Are intended for money laundering**, including scams with payments and rewards and the placement of fake tasks.

   If these types of tasks or a fraudulent requester are discovered, Toloka has the right to suspend their access to the platform and take other measures it deems appropriate for stopping the requester, including blocking their profile, limiting their ability to post tasks, and restricting their use of the Toloka website.

## Requirements for task names and descriptions

The name of the task must match its content, description, and instructions.

**You can't post tasks with names that:**

- Are written in uppercase.
- Contain multiple capital letters, emojis, question marks, and exclamation marks.
- Encourage performers to complete the task by promising easy and fast earnings or contain other calls to action aimed at promoting the task.
- Contain obscene or profane language.
- Contain unreadable characters, code elements, and links.
- Mention illegal actions or prohibited goods and services.
- Contradict the applicable legislation.

Toloka reserves the right to check the platform's public resources and block tasks that do not meet the aforementioned conditions.
