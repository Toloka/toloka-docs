## Labeling results

<YFMDefinition title="Why can't I download the results?">

The **Download results** button is only available for batches with the **Completed** status. Wait until the labeling is completed and return to the batch after a while.

</YFMDefinition>

<YFMDefinition title="How do I find out how long it took to label my data?">

Select the desired batch. The section on the right will show all available statistics.

</YFMDefinition>

## Uploading data for labeling

<YFMDefinition title="What should I add to a batch?">

Batches are datasets that need to be labeled. Add to batches TSV files with IDs and links to media files.

</YFMDefinition>

Example of filling in a TSV file:

  ```
  id  image_url
  1   https://yastat.net/s3/tb/static/file-examples/special/street.jpg
  ```

<YFMDefinition title="My project is being moderated. Can I add task items to it?">

Yes. You can add task items to projects in the **Active** or **Pending** status.
