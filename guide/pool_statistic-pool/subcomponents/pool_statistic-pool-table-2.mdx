The average time for completing a [task suite](/docs/glossary#task-suite) in the pool. Specified in seconds.

Calculated based on 1000 recently completed task suites.

<Cut title="Recommendations">

If the average time is longer than you expected, and the quality of results is low, recheck the instructions.

Perhaps your tasks are too complicated. Use [decomposition](/docs/guide/solution-architecture) and check the task interface. Then try testing your task on the same Tolokers in the training or survey format.

If the average time is short, and the quality of results is low, review [quality control settings](/docs/guide/control).
