The amount of money spent in the pool. The [fee](/docs/guide/budget) amount is shown in parentheses.

If you spent more than you planned, check the price settings in the pool and the quality control rules. For example, [Dynamic pricing](/docs/guide/dynamic-pricing#section_ucl_3hl_vlb) and [Recompletion of assignments from banned users](/docs/guide/restore-task-overlap) increase the cost of the pool.

<Cut title="Recommendations">

First, check the [quality control rules](/docs/guide/control), disable the rules that increase overlap, and then revise the price per task suite. You might need to reduce it. but don't make it unreasonably small.

You can also increase or decrease the number of tasks per suite and adjust the price accordingly.
