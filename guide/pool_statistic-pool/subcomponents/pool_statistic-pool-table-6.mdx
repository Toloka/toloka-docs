If you think that this number is too large or small, you may have incorrectly configured [Recompletion of assignments from banned users](/docs-new/guide/restore-task-overlap) or [Processing rejected and accepted tasks](/docs-new/guide/reassessment-after-accepting). You may also want to check:

- [Dynamic overlap](/docs-new/guide/dynamic-overlap) (incremental relabeling, IRL).

- [Random majority vote check](/docs-new/guide/selective-mvote).
