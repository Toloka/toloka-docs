The number of expired task suites.

Includes the pages that Tolokers failed to complete on time or decided to skip. You specify the time allotted for a task suite when [setting up a pool](/docs-new/guide/pool-main#table_n3q_vhz_jlb).

When the Toloker decides not to do the task (clicks **Exit**), the task gets the expired status. In this case, the Toloker can return to the task again, unless it was completed by someone else or the requester deleted it from the pool.

<Cut title="Recommendations">

Tolokers might have skipped the task suite because:

- Tasks are too complex.
- There are too many tasks on the page.
- Tasks don't work and Tolokers can't submit the assignments.
- Tolokers couldn't understand the instructions and task interface.

If you have a lot of expired task suites in your pool, we recommend that you read our[Tips for designing tasks](/docs-new/guide/faq).
