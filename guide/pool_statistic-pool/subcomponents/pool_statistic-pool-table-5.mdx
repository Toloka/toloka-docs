- **Submitted** — The number of task suites submitted for review.

- **Accepted** — The number of accepted task suites.

- **Skipped** — The number of task suites [skipped by Tolokers](/docs/guide/pool_statistic-pool#skipped-tasks).

If you have a lot of skipped or expired tasks, we recommend that you read our [Tips for designing tasks](/docs/guide/faq) and set up the [skipped assignments](/docs/guide/skipped-assignments) rule.
