This indicator uses available data to predict the total cost. If you are not satisfied with it, stop the pool and change the settings. Think about whether you need [dynamic overlap](/docs-new/guide/dynamic-overlap), [dynamic pricing](/docs-new/guide/dynamic-pricing), and, for example, [recompletion of assignments from banned users](/docs-new/guide/restore-task-overlap).

Review the price per task suite. You might be able to lower it without losing Tolokers.
