# Using the skill

You can use skills to filter and select Tolokers when assigning tasks, issuing rewards, and sending out messages.

## Selecting Tolokers for tasks {#selection}

When setting up a pool, you can use skills in [filters](/docs/guide/filters) to:

- Select Tolokers without a skill. To do this, use the `=`, and leave the value empty.
- Select Tolokers with any skill value. Use the `≠` operator, and leave the value empty.
- Select Tolokers who have a skill value greater than or less than the specified one.

For example, you can select only those Tolokers whose skill is more than 66 or is missing:

For [global skills](/docs/guide/nav-cross-project), the restrictions of the `skill >80`type are used to select “Tolokers who completed similar projects 80% better on average than other Tolokers”.

## Extra rewards {#awarding}

To select Tolokers by skill and give them [rewards](/docs/glossary#reward):

1. Go to the [Tolokers](https://platform.toloka.ai/requester/workers) page.

1. Select Tolokers using the skill filter. To do this, use [filters](/docs/glossary#filters):

    1. Click **Add filter**.

    1. Scroll down and choose **Choose skill**.

    1. Specify the skill and the required skill value.

1. To credit rewards to one Toloker, click the link to their ID in the **Toloker ID** field.

    On the page that opens, click **Actions → Issue bonus**.

    To credit rewards to a group of Tolokers click **Issue bonus**.

1. Fill in the fields in the **Issue bonus** window that appears:

    - **Bonus per user** in dollars.

    - **Topic** and **Message** for Tolokers. Specify the projects and accomplishments the reward was granted for. To send messages in different languages, use the button for switching languages.

1. Click **Grant**.

    Before doing this, check the number of people who will receive the reward, and the total amount.
