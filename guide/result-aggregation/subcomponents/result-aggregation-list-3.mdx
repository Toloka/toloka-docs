To run aggregation, you must correctly set up dynamic overlap. To do this:

1. Select a skill. We recommend to select a skill calculated as the percentage of [correct responses in control tasks](/docs-new/guide/goldenset). This will give you the most accurate aggregation results.

1. Select the output data fields.

<Cut title="Output data fields that can be aggregated:">

- Strings and numbers with allowed values.

    The allowed value must match the `value` parameter in the corresponding interface element.

- Boolean.

- Integers with minimum and maximum values. The maximum difference between them is 32.

If there are too many possible responses in the output field, the dynamic overlap mechanism won't be able to aggregate the data.

The allowed value must match the `value` parameter in the corresponding interface element.

</Cut>
