If you want to see what your project will look like after the launch, but you don't have any labeling tasks yet, you can upload ready-made sample data to the pool. Sample data is available for the templates:

- **Image classification**
- **Product search relevance**
- **Object recognition & detection**
- **Clickbait or not?**

Click **Use sample data** next to **Attach the prepared file with data**. This lets you avoid any additional actions with files.

Once you've finished working with the sample data and everything looks good, prepare your data and upload it to the pool.
