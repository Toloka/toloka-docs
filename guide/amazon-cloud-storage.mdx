# Amazon S3

<Note mode="note" title="Note">

You can use any photo hosting service to add a small number of images, such as [imgbb](https://imgbb.com/), [ImageShack](https://imageshack.com/), or [imgur](https://imgur.com/). This way you can quickly get direct links to your images to add them to the task file or instructions.

</Note>

To try out [S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/?nc1=h_ls), you can activate a [free trial](https://aws.amazon.com/free).

1. Enter the bucket name. The name must be unique and must not contain spaces or upper-case letters.

1. Select the region closest to your Tolokers. For example, for Tolokers from Germany: .

1. To make files in the bucket available by link, disable the option **Block all public access** in the **Block Public Access settings for this bucket** section.

    <Note mode="note" title="Note">

    Files will be accessible to anyone with a link. We recommend using hashed file names to keep your files secure. You can generate hashes using online tools (for example, [Online MD5 Hash Generator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function)). Learn more about [hashing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function).

    To make your files easier to navigate, add [tags](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/CostAllocTagging.html).

1. Click **Create bucket**.

<Note mode="note" title="Note">

You can set the lifetime of files in the bucket so that they are automatically deleted after a specified number of days. [Learn more](https://aws.amazon.com/ru/blogs/aws/amazon-s3-object-expiration/).

    <Note mode="note" title="Note">

    All symbols except for Latin letters will be replaced with codes, and spaces will be replaced with plus signs.

    </Note>

1. All file links are created by the same template.

    Links look like this:

    ```plaintext
    https://<bucket-name>.s3.<region-code>.amazonaws.com/<filename>
    ```

    The link in the folder looks like this:

    ```plaintext
    https://<bucket-name>.s3.<region-code>.amazonaws.com/<path-to-file>/<filename>
    ```

    <Note mode="note" title="Note">

    To quickly get links to other files, copy the link to one of them and replace `<file-name>` with the names of other files.

    </Note>

1. In the [file with tasks](/docs-new/guide/pool_csv), paste the links in the column that matches the input data field to which this data is passed.

    For example, if you want to use images in the `image` field, specify the file links in the `INPUT:image` column:

    ```plaintext
    INPUT:image
    https://mybucket.s3.eu-north-1.amazonaws.com/newfolder/image1.png
    https://mybucket.s3.eu-north-1.amazonaws.com/newfolder/image2.png
    ```
