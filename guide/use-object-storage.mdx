# Yandex Object Storage

<Note mode="note" title="Note">

You can use any photo hosting service to add a small number of images, such as [wampi](https://wampi.ru/?lang=en), [imgbb](https://imgbb.com/), [ImageShack](https://imageshack.com/), or [imgur](https://imgur.com/). This way you can quickly get direct links to your images to add them to the task file or instructions.

</Note>

To try out [Yandex Cloud](https://cloud.yandex.com/docs/storage/quickstart), you can activate a [Free trial](https://cloud.yandex.com/en-ru/docs/free-trial/).

**Trial terms**

Length | Free storage size | Grant amount
----- | ----- | -----
60 days | 5 TB | $50

## Steps to follow {#concept_ebz_yz4_nlb}

To use files from Yandex Cloud:

1. Create a bucket in Object Storage. To learn how to do this, go to [Getting started](https://cloud.yandex.com/docs/storage/quickstart).

    <Note mode="note" title="Note">

    Create a bucket with public access. This way you won't need to generate a link to each file separately.

    </Note>

1. Select a bucket and upload your files. Files will be accessible to anyone with a link. We recommend using hashed file names to keep your files secure. You can generate hashes using online tools (for example, [Online MD5 Hash Generator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function)). Learn more about [hashing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function).

    <Note mode="note" title="Note">

    You can set the lifetime of files in the bucket so that they are automatically deleted after a specified number of days. [Learn more](https://cloud.yandex.com/en-ru/docs/storage/operations/buckets/lifecycles).

    </Note>

1. If you restricted access to the bucket, you need to get a separate link for each file by following the [instructions](https://cloud.yandex.com/docs/storage/operations/objects/link-for-download).

    Select a file and click **Get a link → Copy**.

    All file links are created by the same template.

    Links look like this:

    ```plaintext
    https://<bucket-name>.s3.<region-code>.amazonaws.com/<filename>
    ```

    The link in the folder looks like this:

    ```plaintext
    https://<bucket-name>.s3.<region-code>.amazonaws.com/<path-to-file>/<filename>
    ```

    <Note mode="note" title="Note">

    To quickly get links to other files, copy the link to one of them and replace `<filename>` with the names of other files.

    </Note>

1. In the [file with tasks](/docs-new/guide/pool_csv), paste the links in the column that matches the input data field to which this data is passed.

    For example, if you want to use images in the `image` field, specify the file links in the `INPUT:image` column:

    ```plaintext
    INPUT:image
    https://storage.yandexcloud.net/my-bucket/1.jpg
    https://storage.yandexcloud.net/my-bucket/2.jpg
    ```
