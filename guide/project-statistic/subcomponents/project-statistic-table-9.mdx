The graph shows two indicators:

- **On the project** — Number of Tolokers banned from the project.
- **By the requester** — Number of Tolokers blocked by the requester.

Note that the graph only shows banned Tolokers. It doesn't include Tolokers whose access is suspended.

If there are too many blocked Tolokers, review and adjust the quality control rules.
