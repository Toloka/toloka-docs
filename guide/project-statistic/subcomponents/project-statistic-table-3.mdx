If you think that this number is too large or small, you may have incorrectly configured [Recompletion of assignments from banned Tolokers](/docs/guide/restore-task-overlap) or [Processing rejected and accepted tasks](/docs/guide/reassessment-after-accepting). You may also want to check:

- [Random majority vote check](/docs/guide/selective-mvote).
