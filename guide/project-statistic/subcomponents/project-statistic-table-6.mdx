The average price in USD per general task in the project, including overlap.

Note that this is the price per task, not per suite with overlap. The Toloka fee isn't taken into account when calculating the average task price.

If you think that the price is too high, check the price settings in the pool and the quality control rules. For example, [Dynamic pricing](/docs-new/guide/dynamic-pricing#section_ucl_3hl_vlb) and [Recompletion of assignments from banned Tolokers](/docs-new/guide/restore-task-overlap) increase the cost of the pool.
