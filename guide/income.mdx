# Earnings

If you want to have a large number of Tolokers in a project, limit the daily earnings in the [project](/docs/glossary#project).

Ban by earnings works for the [pool](/docs/glossary#pool). If you set up a blocking rule for the project, the earnings are calculated separately for each pool.

<Cut title="Example">

The project has a rule set up that bans the Toloker if their earnings exceed $5 in the last 24 hours. If the Toloker earns more than $5 in one of the pools, they can no longer access this pool. If they earn $2 in each of three project pools, they won't be banned.

</Cut>

## When to use {#when-use}

Limit the Toloker's daily earnings in the pool if you want to:

- Get responses from as many Tolokers as possible. For this purpose, you might want to set the maximum amount of earnings equal to the price for a single [task suite](/docs/glossary#task-suite).

- Provide protection from robots. For this purpose, set maximum earnings to a higher amount, like 10% of the entire pool cost.

<Note mode="note" title="Note">

Set an amount that Tolokers can realistically earn in a day, otherwise the rule will be pointless.

</Note>

## How to configure {#rule}

<Note mode="restriction" title="Alert">

All fields in this rule are required. If you don't fill in at least one of them, you won't be able to save the rule.

</Note>

**Field** | **Overview**
----- | -----
**If** | <IncomeTable1/>
**then** | <IncomeTable2/>

<Note mode="warning" title="Warning">

The assignments submitted by banned Tolokers will be taken into account if they are not rejected using manual review. They can be reassigned by setting up the [Recompletion of assignments from banned users](/docs/guide/restore-task-overlap) rule.

</Note>

## Rule example {#examples}

**Task**: you're conducting a sociological survey. To collect responses from as many Tolokers as possible, set up the **earnings** rule.

#### Correct settings

If the Toloker's earnings exceed 5 dollars in the last 24 hours, they lose access to the pool and can't complete your tasks.
