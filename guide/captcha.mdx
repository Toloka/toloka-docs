# Captcha

<CaptchaWarning/>

Captchas and the [Fast responses](/docs-new/guide/quick-answers) rule provide a high level of protection from robots.

To show a captcha to Tolokers, set captcha frequency in the [pool](/docs-new/glossary#pool) settings.

In Toloka, a captcha is normally shown once every 10 assignments. If responses are given quickly and captchas get in the way, they can be shown every 20 assignments.

## When to use {#when-use}

Restrict access to tasks for Tolokers who fail to enter captcha several times in a row. This setting is necessary if you want to provide additional protection from robots.

#### Don't use it if:

- There aren't very many tasks in the pools. For example, if the task is a survey on a single page, a captcha won't help you control the quality, since the minimum frequency of captcha display is every 10 assignments.

- It's difficult or impossible to automate user actions: selecting areas, performing field tasks or any tasks where Tolokers need to attach files or write meaningful texts.

## How to configure {#rule}

<Note mode="warning" title="Warning">

The **If** and **then** fields in this rule are required. If you don't fill in at least one field, you won't be able to save the rule.

</Note>

**Field**  | **Overview**
----- | -----
**Recent captchas to use** | The number of times the Toloker was shown a captcha recently.<br/><br/>If this field is not filled in, the calculation includes only captcha entries from the pool to which the rule is applied.<br/><br/>If the field is filled in, the corresponding number of captcha entries is used. The rule takes into account captcha entries from both this pool and other pools where this field is filled in.<br/><br/>[Learn more](/docs-new/guide/remember-values) about how this field works.
**If** | <CaptchaTable1/>
**then** | <CaptchaTable2/>

## Rule example {#examples}

Since a person can also make a mistake when entering a captcha, it's advisable to add the **number of responses** field and set a value greater than 1. Otherwise, the Toloker will be banned after the first captcha entry.

<Note mode="warning" title="Warning">

The assignments submitted by banned Tolokers will be taken into account if they are not rejected using manual review. They can be reassigned by setting up the [Recompletion of assignments from banned users](/docs-new/guide/restore-task-overlap) rule.

</Note>
