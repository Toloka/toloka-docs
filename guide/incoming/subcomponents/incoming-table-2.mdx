Allows you to hide data from the Toloker. If this is not done, Tolokers can get the field value programmatically. You can configure this parameter in JSON mode.

For example, you can hide the `assigment_id` identifier you will need when [reviewing assignments](/docs/glossary#assignment-review) in a separate project.

By default, the field is visible â€” `false`.

Hidden fields are not available in the task interface, even through JS or the template code in the constructor.
