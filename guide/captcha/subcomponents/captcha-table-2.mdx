Action to perform for the condition:

- **ban** — Block access to the project or all of the requester's projects for the specified number of days. Only the requester can view the reason.

    If access to tasks is blocked temporarily (for example, for 7 days), the history of the Toloker's responses is not saved after the ban is lifted. The skill value is based on new responses.

- **assign skill from the field** — Save the percentage of the Toloker's correctly entered captchas in tasks as a [skill](/docs-new/guide/nav) value.

- **suspend** — Suspend the Toloker's access to the pool for the specified number of days. Only the requester can view the reason.

- **accept all assignments from this Toloker in the pool** — Requires the [manual review](/docs-new/guide/offline-accept) option to be set.

    Useful if the Toloker completes most tasks well. Example: The Toloker completed more than 80% of the tasks correctly and you are satisfied with this result. The rule will work automatically and accept all responses in the pool.

- **assign skill value** — Assign a fixed value to the [skill](/docs-new/guide/nav).
