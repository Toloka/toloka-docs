This review method is also suitable when the result is not displayed in the interface.

Example 1: The task uses JS code, and the response contains initially hidden fields.

Example 2: The task where you need to download files attached by the Toloker (for example, video or audio recordings) to check the responses.

</Note>

    **What does the response archive contain?**

    The system automatically assigns names to files when they are uploaded by the Toloker. You can rename the files manually or with a script if necessary.

    - `Response archive`

        - `Folder1_ID_ responses`

            - `File1_ID_attachments`

            - `File2_ID_attachments`

        - `Folder2_ID_ responses`

    You can match responses and attachments by their IDs. Attachment ID is included in the TSV file, in the column with the output field where the file was uploaded.

    - `TSV file`

        - `Column1_with_output_field`

            - `ID_attachments`

        - `Column2_with_output_field`

            - `ID_attachments`

    </Note>

1. Open the [file with responses](/docs-new/guide/result-of-eval).

    For a single response ID, you need to fill in the verdict and comment only once. The rest should be left empty or deleted.

    - If there is one task on the page, add a verdict and a comment to each response ID (if there is a deviation).
    - If there is more than one task on the page, then different tasks on the page will have the same response ID.

    **Explanation**

    - `ASSIGNMENT:assignment_id` — ID of the assigned task suite.

    - `ACCEPT:verdict` — Review result:

    - “+” if you accept the responses.

    - “-” if you reject the responses.

    - `ACCEPT:comment` — Comments for Tolokers if responses were rejected (for example, specify which part of the [instructions](/docs-new/glossary#instructions) wasn't followed).

1. Upload the edited TSV file to Toloka (**Import/ Export → Upload results**).

<Cut title="Delegate manual review to other Tolokers.">

Place a separate task for Tolokers to review the responses. To learn how to do it, see the [last project](/docs-new/tutorials/image-segmentation-project3) in the [Selecting an image area](/docs-new/tutorials/image-segmentation-overview). It implements manual review with the help of Tolokers.
