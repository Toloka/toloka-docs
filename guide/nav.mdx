# Toloker skills

Skill can be any characteristic of the Toloker. It is described by a number from 0 to 100. For example, you can record the percentage of correct responses in a skill.

In addition to skills created by requesters, Toloka has [global skills](/docs-new/guide/nav-cross-project).

## How do I use skills? {#what-next}

1. [Create a skill](/docs-new/guide/nav-create). You create skills yourself.

1. [Assign a skill](/docs-new/guide/nav-assign) either manually or automatically.

1. [Use the skill](/docs-new/guide/nav-use), for example, to select Tolokers or manage overlap or price.

If necessary, you can:

- [Edit](/docs-new/guide/nav-edit) the skill value manually.
- [Remove](/docs-new/guide/nav-delete) skill for a specific Toloker.
- [View the history](/docs-new/guide/nav-history) of skill changes.
