Action to perform for the condition:

- **ban** — Block access to the project or all of the requester's projects for the specified number of days. Only the requester can view the reason.<br/><br/>    If access to tasks is blocked temporarily (for example, for 7 days), the history of the Toloker's responses is not saved after the ban is lifted. The skill value is based on new responses.

- **accept user's answers** — Requires the [manual review](/docs-new/guide/offline-accept) option to be set.<br/><br/>    Useful if the Toloker completes most tasks well. Example: The Toloker completed more than 80% of the tasks correctly and you are satisfied with this result. The rule will work automatically and accept all responses in the pool.

- **suspend** — Suspend the Toloker's access to the pool for the specified number of days. Only the requester can view the reason.

- **assign skill value** — Assign a fixed value to the [skill](/docs-new/guide/nav).
