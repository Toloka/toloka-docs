# Tips for designing tasks

This section includes links to sections of the guide and blog posts with tips and recommendations for creating tasks.

## Where to create tasks {#where}

To make it easier and faster to launch projects in Toloka, we developed a new tool â€” Template Builder. It's a user-friendly **JSON** interface editor. You can also use the [HTML/JS/CSS editor](/docs-new/guide/spec).

Read in the blog:

- Learn about the benefits of Template Builder and how to use it in the article [Template Builder in Toloka](https://toloka.ai/blog/template-builder).

- [Toloka Digest](https://toloka.ai/blog/toloka-digest).

You can also read the [Template Builder Help](/docs-new/template-builder/).

## How to create tasks {#how}

### Decomposition {#decomposition}

Tolokers do better with short, uniform tasks. Use [decomposition](/docs-new/glossary#decomposition) to simplify a task. This will help lower costs and improve the quality of the results.

Learn more about the benefits of decomposition and when to use it in [Task decomposition](/docs-new/guide/solution-architecture).

To learn how to use decomposition correctly, see [Object recognition and area selection](/docs-new/tutorials/image-segmentation-overview).

You can also read [Mistakes related to project architecture](/docs-new/guide/frequent-customer-errors#mistakes-architecture).

### Task interface {#task-interface}

A clear and user-friendly interface improves the quality of results, helps Tolokers complete tasks faster, and lets you set a lower price per task.

Read about how to create a good interface in our blog [Guidelines for Effective Interfaces](https://toloka.ai/blog/effective-interface).

Also see the following sections:

- [Mistakes related to the task interface](/docs-new/guide/frequent-customer-errors#interface-mistakes)

- [Adapt a task for mobile devices](/docs-new/guide/mobile)

## Uploading tasks {#download-task}

If your tasks are not displayed or are displayed incorrectly, Tolokers are unable to complete them, and you lose time and money.

You can also read [Mistakes related to uploading tasks](/docs-new/guide/frequent-customer-errors#loading-tasks-mistakes).

## How to get good responses {#how-to-get}

### Quality control rules {#quality-control-rules}

Quality control rules allow you to get more accurate responses and restrict access to tasks for cheating users.

Read the following sections:

- [Mistakes in quality control settings](/docs-new/guide/frequent-customer-errors#quality-control-mistakes)
- [How to check Tolokers](/docs-new/guide/check-performers)

### Filters {#filters}

Properly configured filters help you filter out Tolokers and send tasks to a target group of Tolokers. As a result, you'll get your results faster and spend less money.
