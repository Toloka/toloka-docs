To get a file with Tolokers' responses, click the **Download results** button on the [pool](/docs-new/glossary#pool) page.

<Note mode="restriction" title="Alert">

The responses submitted by the banned Toloker before the ban will be taken into account and paid for. To exclude their responses from the results and aggregations, select the option **Exclude assignments from banned users**. It will delete the responses from users who were banned at the moment of downloading the results, not when the pool was labeled.
