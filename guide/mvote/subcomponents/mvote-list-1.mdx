Both rules work independently:

1. If the Toloker gives at least 3 responses to the tasks, the percentage of correct answers is written as the skill value.

1. If the Toloker gives at least 3 answers to tasks and the percentage of correct answers is less than 65%, they are banned on the project.

The calculation uses up to 10 Toloker's responses to the project tasks.
