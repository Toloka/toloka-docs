Action to perform for the condition:

- **ban** — Block access to the project or all of the requester's projects for the specified number of days. Only the requester can view the reason.

    If access to tasks is blocked temporarily (for example, for 7 days), the history of the Toloker's responses is not saved after the ban is lifted. The skill level is calculated based on the new responses.

- **suspend** — Suspend the Toloker's access to the pool for the specified number of days. Only the requester can view the reason.

- **assign skill value** — Assign a fixed value to the [skill](/docs-new/guide/nav).

- **assign skill from the field** — Save the percentage of the Toloker's correct responses in tasks as a skill value.

- **accept user's answers** — Requires the [manual review](/docs-new/guide/offline-accept) option to be set.

    Useful if the Toloker completes most tasks well. Example: The Toloker completed more than 80% of the tasks correctly and you are satisfied with this result. The rule will work automatically and accept all responses in the pool.
