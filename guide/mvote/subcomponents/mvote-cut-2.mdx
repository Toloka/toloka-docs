<Cut title="Example">

Let's say the pool has `Overlap = 5` and `Accept as majority = 2`. The Tolokers completed the task.

|           | Task response |
|-----------|---------------|
| Toloker 1 | OK            |
| Toloker 2 | OK            |
| Toloker 3 | BAD           |
| Toloker 4 | BAD           |
| Toloker 5 | 404           |

In this case, Tolokers 1, 2, 3, and 4 responded correctly, but Toloker 5 failed. However, you don't have any way to know which response is correct.
