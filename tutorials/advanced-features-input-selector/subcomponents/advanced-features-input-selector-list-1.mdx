The template uses a special component for easier development. Learn more in [Checkbox](https://toloka.ai/en/docs/guide/concepts/t-components/checkboxes).

#### Editing the output specification

Add a new field:

`checkbox_result` — checkbox (boolean).

Add a field for each checkbox you need and give them unique names. For example, if you need three checkboxes, add three fields with the names `checkbox_result1`, `checkbox_result2`, and `checkbox_result3`.

#### Editing HTML

1. The HTML code consists of blocks describing various interface elements. Each block may contain other blocks within it. There may be several nesting levels. For example, the block with a response button description contains other blocks with input fields. Each field contains other elements, such as a title and a comment field.

    Each block looks like this:

    ```html
    <div class="block_name">
    <!-- code for the block that may contain nested blocks -->
    ...
    </div>
    ```

1. Find the `main` block (it starts with `<div class="main">`). It contains several `main_block` blocks within it, each describing one of the buttons. For example, the “Photos of product and price tag” template has 4 response buttons, which means that its `main` block contains 4 `main_block` blocks for each of the buttons.

    Each button has a name for accessing its properties. For example, the buttons in the “Photos of product and price tag” template are named `btn_ok`, `btn_no_price`, `btn_no_item`, and `btn_no_shop`. Remember the name of the button that you are adding new fields to in the code.

    The `main_content` block inside `main__block` contains all the fields for the selected button. The description of each field is located in `main__content-block`.

    Find the button in the `main__block` block, then find the `main__content-block` field where you want to add a new field and paste the following code after it:

    ```html
    <!-- checkbox -->
    <div class="main__content-block">
    <div class="main__content-title main__content-title_req">
    {{texts.btn_ok.question_new_checkbox.title}}
    </div>
    <div class="main__text">
    {{texts.btn_ok.question_new_checkbox.description}}
    </div>
    <div class="main__box">
    {{field type="checkbox" name="checkbox_result" label="checkbox" size="L"}}
    </div>
    </div>
    ```

    In this code, a checkbox is added to the button with the name `btn_ok`. If you added a checkbox to another button, replace `btn_ok` with the relevant button's name.

    The checkboxes are listed in the`main__box` blocks as strings:

    ```html
    {{field type="checkbox" name="checkbox_result" label="checkbox" size="L"}}
    ```

    In the code above, one checkbox is added. The output value will be passed to the `checkbox_result` field that you added to the output specification.

    To add multiple checkboxes, paste the same strings in the code for each of the fields you added to the output specification. Change the value of the `name` parameter for each of the checkboxes to what you named them in the output specification. For example, if you added new fields for three checkboxes to the output specification, insert this string three times and then change the `"checkbox_result"` values in each line to what you named them in the specification.

    Change the value of the `label` parameter. It contains a caption displayed next to the checkbox.

1. Update the acceptance mode.

    The `review` block contains the code for each button in the acceptance mode. This code is located in the following blocks:

    ```html
    {{#if (equal verdict "ok")}}
    <!-- code for the "ok" button in acceptance mode -->
    <div class="review__block">
    <!-- code for the "ok" button field in acceptance mode -->
    ...
    </div>
    ...
    {{/if}}
    ```

    The value of the response button selected by the Toloker is passed to the `verdict` variable specified in the output specification.

    For example, in the “Photos of product and price tag” template, 4 values are described for 4 buttons: `ok`, `no_price`, `no_item`, and `no_shop`.

    The `review__block` blocks contain a description of each field for this button.

    Find the button by searching for the string `{{#if (equal verdict "response_button_value")}}`, then find the `review__block`, field where you want to add a new field and insert the following code after it:

    ```html
    <!-- checkbox -->
    <div class="review__block">
    <div class="review__title">
    {{texts.btn_ok.question_new_checkbox.title}}
    </div>
    <div class="review__box">
    {{field type="checkbox" name="checkbox_result" label="checkbox" size="L"}}
    </div>
    </div>
    ```

    In this code, a checkbox is added to the button with the name `btn_ok`. If you added a checkbox to another button, replace `btn_ok` with the relevant button's name.

    The checkboxes are listed in the `review__box` block as strings:

    ```html
    {{field type="checkbox" name="checkbox_result" label="checkbox" size="L"}}
    ```

    In the code above, one checkbox is added. The output value will be passed to the `checkbox_result` field that you added to the output specification.

    To add multiple checkboxes, paste the same strings in the code for each of the fields you added to the output specification. Change the value of the `name` parameter for each of the checkboxes to what you named them in the output specification. For example, if you added new fields for three checkboxes to the output specification, insert this string three times and then change the `"checkbox_result"` values in each line to what you named them in the specification.

    Change the value of the `label` parameter. It contains a caption displayed next to the checkbox.

#### Editing JS

1. The JS code consists of blocks describing various interface elements. These blocks can be nested (buttons contain a set of fields, fields contain a set of elements, and so on). Each block is enclosed in curly brackets.

    The elements are described as follows:

    ```plaintext
    'property': 'value'
    ```

    The value can also consist of several properties, in which case it is enclosed in curly brackets and forms the next level of nesting.

1. The `texts` constant at the very beginning of the file stores all texts for each button.

    Each button has a name for accessing its properties. For example, the buttons in the “Photos of product and price tag” template are named `btn_ok`, `btn_no_price`, `btn_no_item`, and `btn_no_shop`. Remember the name of the button that you are adding new text to in the code.

    For example, in the “Photos of product and price tag” template, the texts for the `btn_ok` button are located in the following code block:

    ```javascript
    var texts = {
    //<common header text>
    'btn_ok': {
    'title': 'I found the price tag for the product',
    'question_1': {
    //<texts for the first field (photos of the store's front)>
    },
    'question_2': {
    //<texts for the second field (product photos)>
    },
    'question_3': {
    //<texts for the third field (photo of the price tag)>
    }
    },
    ```

1. To add the texts for checkboxes, put a comma after the curly bracket that closes the last field and paste the following code:

    ```javascript
    'question_new_checkbox': {
    'title': 'Checkbox',
    'description': 'Select an answer'
    }
    ```

    Change the values of the `title` and `description` properties. The `title` property contains a title displayed above the group of checkboxes, and the `description` property contains a question for Tolokers.

1. Validation.

    The checkbox can be checked or unchecked, and both values are valid, so there are no separate validation rules for checkboxes.

    <Note mode="note" title="Note">

    If you mark the checkbox as required in the output specification, it does not mean that it must be selected. Checkboxes are boolean and take one of two values: `true` or `false`.

    </Note>
