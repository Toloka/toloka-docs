1. The task interface describes how the elements should be arranged in the task.

    The template has pre-configured validation. The Toloker won't be able to submit a response without selecting one of the options.

    For more information, see the Template Builder Help:

    - [Setting up conditions](/docs-new/template-builder/best-practices/conditions).
    - [Image classification](/docs-new/template-builder/templates/image-classification) template.

1. On the **Configuration** panel, replace lines 19 to 28 in the code:

    ```json
    "label": "What is the cat's mood?",
    "options": [
        {
            "label": "Good",
            "value": "ok"
        },
        {
            "label": "Bad",
            "value": "bad"
        },
    ```

    with:

    ```json
    "label": "Are there traffic signs in the picture?",
    "options": [
        {
            "label": "Yes",
            "value": "ok"
        },
        {
            "label": "No",
            "value": "bad"
        },
        ```

1. Click **Show specifications** to see the input and output data fields.

    Input data fields are created from the code on the **Example of input data** tab.

    The output data fields depend on the components that use `data.output` and values supported by it.

    Learn more about [input and output data fields](/docs-new/template-builder/operations/create-specs) in the Template Builder Help.

    - Input data field: `image` — A link to an image.

        Change the data type to string to add links to your files.

    - Output data field: `result` — string for saving the Toloker's response.

    <Cut title="What are input and output data?">

    **Input data** is types of objects that are passed to the Toloker for completing the task. For example, this could be a text, an image, or geographic coordinates.

    **Output data** is types of objects that you receive after the task is completed. For example, this could be one of several response options, typed text, or an uploaded file.

    If you add interface elements to the task template, the corresponding fields in the **Data specification** block will be created automatically.
