##### Personalized quality forecast {#personilized-quality-forecast}

##### Plugin components (Template Builder) {#plugin}

A category of [components](#component) that enable advanced features. For example, `plugin.hotkeys` lets you set up shortcuts. [List of plugins](/docs-new/template-builder/reference/plugins)

##### Pool {#pool}

A set of data to label in a project. You can use the pool settings to select Tolokers, set the price for tasks, and add various quality control rules. Tasks in a pool share the same properties (such as Toloker selection settings and payment per [task suite](#task-suite)) and are sent out for completion at the same time.

##### Project {#project}

A specific data labeling goal. This could be to moderate comments, to classify images, to transcribe audio recordings, or something else. A project consists of [pools](#pool) with [tasks](#task). Project settings define the [task interface](#task-interface) and the [input and output data](#input-output-data).

##### Project preset {#project-template}

A pre-configured project that contains description, instruction, predefined [input and output data](#input-output-data) fields, and the [task interface](#task-interface) which you can edit.
