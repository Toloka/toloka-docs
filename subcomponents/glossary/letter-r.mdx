##### Recompletion of assignments from banned users (quality control rule) {#recompletion}

A [quality control](#quality-control) rule that can be configured to resend tasks for recompletion to other Tolokers if:

  - [The Toloker is banned](#banning-tolokers) by a [quality control rule](#quality-control-rule) (for example, [control tasks](#control-task) or [majority vote](#majority-vote)).
  - The Toloker's [skill](#skill) value changed (for example, the Toloker's skill value dropped and they no longer match the skill [filter](#filters)).

All [pool](#pool) tasks completed by this Toloker will be resent to other Tolokers. Tasks completed by banned Tolokers are reassigned, but those completed by paused Tolokers are not.

##### Response {#response}

The result of completing an assignment by a Toloker. The responses can be either correct or incorrect. You can decline incorrect responses using the [assignment review](#assignment-review) and even [block Tolokers](#banning-tolokers) who give too many incorrect responses.

##### Retry pool {#retry-pool}

A pool that helps Tolokers who make mistakes improve their [skills](#skill) and get a second chance to complete tasks.

##### Review period {#review-period}

Number of days for checking Toloker responses [manually](#assignment-review).

##### Review task responses manually {#assignment-review}

A [pool](#pool) setting that allows you to manually check [responses](#response) from Tolokers. You can either accept correct responses or reject poorly completed tasks and not pay for them.

##### Reward {#reward}

Extra payment that you can give to Tolokers for completing tasks well. It improves motivation and encourages Tolokers to approach your tasks with care. You can give rewards to one or more Tolokers (in addition to payment for [completed tasks](#completed-tasks)). The reward amount can be from $0.01 to $100 per Toloker per time.
