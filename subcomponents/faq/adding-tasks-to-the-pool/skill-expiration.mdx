<Cut title="Which parameter affects the skill expiration?">

The validity period of the training skills is controlled by the **Retry after** parameter.

The skill is deleted in the specified number of days if the Toloker:

- Has a skill value lower than in the **Level required** field.

- Didn't complete any tasks linked to the training during this period.

If their skill expires, your Tolokers need to complete the training again.
