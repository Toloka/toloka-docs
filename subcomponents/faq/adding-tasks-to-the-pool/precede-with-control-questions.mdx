<Cut title="How do I precede my task with mandatory control questions to check that the Toloker understood my instructions? Would such training or control tasks be similar to the general tasks?">

The training and control questions must meet your project specification. However, you can create a separate project with your instructions, survey, and sample videos. Then you can assign a skill to Tolokers based on their responses. You can use this skill to admit Tolokers to the main project.
