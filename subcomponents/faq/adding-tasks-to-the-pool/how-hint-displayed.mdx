<Cut title="How is the data from the “hint” column displayed?">

The text from the `hint` field will be shown to the Toloker in a red box at the top of the page if they give a response to the control task that differs from the correct one.

If you need to display the text from the `hint` field in several lines, add hyphens to the file and enclose the text in quotation marks.
