<Cut title="How do I check that the Tolokers don't cheat during training?">

Training helps Tolokers learn how to complete your task and figure out the instructions.

Based on the training results, you can select Tolokers who did well enough for the main pool.

However, the mere fact that a Toloker completes your training pool successfully doesn't guarantee that they will afterwards demonstrate high quality on your general tasks. Tolokers who show a high level of accuracy during the training could have obtained correct responses from others.

Besides the training, be sure to add quality control rules and [control tasks](https://toloka.ai/en/docs/guide/concepts/control) to your main pools. This way you can ensure the quality throughout the task performance process.

If the task requires that the Tolokers send free-format responses or data files, use manual review to pay for tasks after they are reviewed.
