<Cut title="How do I show two different versions of the text to Tolokers?">

If you pass texts to the input data, you can upload 2 different tasks to the pool: pass Text 1 in the `INPUT: <input field name>` field of Task 1. In Task 2, use this field to pass Text 2.

If the text is in the HTML block of the task template, then clone the project. To limit a Toloker to doing only one task in your project, use the [Submitted responses](/docs-new/guide/submitted-answers) rule. You can assign a skill or ban the Toloker after they submit one response.
