<Cut title="What is the maximum number of tasks per suite?">

It depends on the task. Technically, you can use as many tasks you want.

But Tolokers are reluctant to take lengthy tasks. They'd rather do 10 tasks that take one minute each than one task that takes 10 minutes.

In addition, if you use a large number of tasks on the page, there might be issues with uploading the files to be labeled. This problem might occur with images.

The third thing to consider is quality control and manual review. If you use recompletion of assignments from banned Tolokers, you should split the task into smaller parts so that fewer assignments are recompleted. You are more likely to meet your budget this way.
