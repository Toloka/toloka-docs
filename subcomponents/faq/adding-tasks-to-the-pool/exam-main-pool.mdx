<Cut title="What's the difference between the exam pool that I pay for and the main pool?">

Exam is a pool that contains only the control tasks. Usually it's small, and intended to check how Tolokers have learned to do your tasks after they read the instructions and have completed the training.

Unlike your main pool, you already know the correct responses for every task in this pool. You can set the price to zero. Based on the results of the control tasks, you can assign a skill to the Tolokers and then specify it in the main pool as a filter. For example, `≥ 80` or `≠ Is missing`. You don't have to create an exam, because the training pool provides enough practice for simple tasks. But many requesters also use exams.
