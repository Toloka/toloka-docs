<Cut title="How do I create a training pool so that the Toloker might fail it but still be admitted to the general task pool?">

Create a main pool of the **Training** type. Add only [training tasks](/docs-new/glossary#training-task). To assign a skill, use the **Control tasks** rule. To allow access to the general tasks to Tolokers with any skill level, set up the following filter in the main pool: `<skill> >= 0` or `<skill> â‰  0`.

However, we don't advise giving access to general tasks to Tolokers who failed training.
