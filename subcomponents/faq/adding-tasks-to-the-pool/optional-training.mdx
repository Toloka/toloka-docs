<Cut title="How do I make the training optional so that Tolokers can decide themselves whether to take it or not?">

Training is designed to select Tolokers for the general task. That's why training must be linked to the main pool and become inactive as soon as the main pool closes.

The Toloker is trained to get access to your paid tasks. If the training is optional, there probably won't be very many people who choose to complete it. Technically, “optional” training can be based on a main pool that includes some training tasks.

To show the training separately from other pools, disable **Use project description** and use this field to specify that this is an optional set of training tasks. In the pool settings, select the **Training** type.
