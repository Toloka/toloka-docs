<Cut title="I uploaded two files to the training pool. How do I delete one of them?">

After uploading, all tasks are put into one list and can't be deleted separately.

- **If the pool hasn't started yet**, delete all tasks. To do this, click **Delete** in the **Pool tasks** block. Then upload one file to the pool.

- **If the pool already started**, delete tasks [one-by-one in markup mode](/docs/guide/task_markup#delete-task).

</Cut>
