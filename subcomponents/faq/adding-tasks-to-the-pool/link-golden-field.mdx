<Cut title="How do I use a link in the GOLDEN field?">

Text in the GOLDEN field must match the control text exactly.

Usually, if you copy site links from the browser, the copied links have the same format. But this is not the case when the link is trimmed or typed manually.

Check the links that you use. There are several ways to unify links:

- Add requirements for the link format in your instructions and hints in your training pool.

- Use RegExp in your JS to trim the received links and write the result to the new output field, and then match the received value against the control value.
