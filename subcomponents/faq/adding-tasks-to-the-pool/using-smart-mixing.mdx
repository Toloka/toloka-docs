<Cut title="If I upload tasks using smart mixing, does it mean that the same file should contain both the control tasks and general tasks, or can I upload them separately?">

Smart mixing is set up when you upload tasks to the pool. After creating a pool, click **Upload** and select the method for generating task suites. You can upload them using separate files or one file, arranging them in any order.
