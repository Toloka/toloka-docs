<Cut title="Is it possible to use the same account for the Sandbox and the public Toloka version?">

No, you need a separate account for each version of Toloka. To create a task in the [Sandbox](https://toloka.ai/en/docs/glossary#sandbox), [register](https://toloka.ai/en/docs/guide/concepts/access) in it as a requester. To complete your own task, register another account for yourself as a Toloker.
