<Cut title="Fraudulent Tolokers submit assignments with empty response fields. Are they going to be banned before the responses of other Tolokers are known?">

Fraudulent Tolokers aren't banned before the [majority vote](https://toloka.ai/en/docs/guide/concepts/mvote) is known. That's why we recommend that you have new Tolokers complete [training](https://toloka.ai/en/docs/guide/concepts/train) or a test. Then you can select the Tolokers that successfully completed the training to do your tasks.
