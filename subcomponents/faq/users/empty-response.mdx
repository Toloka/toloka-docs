<Cut title="Fraudulent Tolokers submit assignments with empty response fields. Are they going to be banned before the responses of other Tolokers are known?">

Fraudulent Tolokers aren't banned before the [majority vote](/docs-new/guide/mvote) is known. That's why we recommend that you have new Tolokers complete [training](/docs-new/guide/train) or a test. Then you can select the Tolokers that successfully completed the training to do your tasks.
