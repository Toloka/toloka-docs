<Cut title="How do I reward Tolokers in addition to the basic task price?">

You can increase the basic task price for Tolokers that have a higher skill. To do this, set up [Dynamic pricing](/docs/guide/dynamic-pricing). If you want to motivate high-quality Tolokers regardless of their skill, use [rewards](/docs/guide/bonus). In your task instructions, specify the amount and conditions for the Toloker rewards.
