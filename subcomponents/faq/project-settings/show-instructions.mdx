<Cut title="How do I show my instructions to the Toloker inside the task so that they don't need to open or close it?">

There are three options:

- Put your instructions inside the task, but make sure that it doesn't clutter the interface.

- Use [a side window](https://codepen.io/Toloka_projects/pen/YONRWq) for your instructions so that the Toloker can quickly expand or collapse them.

- [Hide the instructions in an expandable section](https://codepen.io/Toloka_projects/pen/NLvaYm) or add hints for the individual interface elements.

For best results, we recommend that you pre-select the Tolokers that meet your requirements and set up the quality control rules.
