<Cut title="How do I enable loading audio files in preview mode?">

You can't check loading of audio files in the preview mode, but you can do it in the sandbox if you do your task. To do this, register in the sandbox as a Toloker and add the Toloker username to your trusted list on the **Tolokers** page. For more information, see [this post](https://toloka.ai/en/docs/guide/concepts/sandbox).
