<Cut title="How do I create a task using both input and output text fields?">

You can see how it's implemented in the [Transcribing audio recordings](https://toloka.ai/en/docs/guide/tutorials/transcript-audio) preset where a string-type output field is used. In the **Text recognition from an image (OCR)** preset, you can view how to describe text input fields. Please note that if you later want to use the Dawid-Skene aggregation method, you must specify allowed values.
