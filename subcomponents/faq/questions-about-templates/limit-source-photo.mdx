<Cut title="Can I limit the source of the photo to camera-only in a field task so that the Toloker can't upload a photo from anywhere else?">

To open the camera instead of the gallery when the Toloker taps the image upload button, in the **Image upload button **component specify `camera=true`.

In the mobile apps, Tolokers can add photos from the default gallery (iOS) or Google photo (Android). To limit the capacity of adding online images, specify in the component `requiredCoordinates=true`. In this case, the system won't let the Toloker add images without geotags.
