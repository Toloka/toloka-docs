<Cut title="How do I create a task with a selection out of three image options with the paired image comparison?">

1. Use the “Side-by-side image comparison” preset.

1. In the file, specify the links to the compared images.

1. In the file, create the tasks where all the images will be compared in pairs:

    - Image 1 and Image 2

    - Image 1 and Image 3

    - Image 2 and Image 3

1. Process the results.

You can also edit the project so that the Toloker sees 3 images at once and selects one of them.
