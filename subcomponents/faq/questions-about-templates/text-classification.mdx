<Cut title="How do I classify texts according to their meanings?">

You can structure your text classification task using the source text and radio buttons. It can also be text and checkboxes if you use multiple subjects.

We recommend that you base it on the **Sentiment analysis & content moderation** preset.

You can also create your own interface. All the available tools are described in the [Requester's guide](https://toloka.ai/en/docs/guide/concepts/spec).
