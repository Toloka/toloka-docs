<Cut title="Can I disable tasks for Tolokers who do a poor job on tasks?">

You can deny access to the pool if the Toloker's responses are [too fast](https://toloka.ai/en/docs/guide/concepts/quick-answers), if they don't match the [majority vote](https://toloka.ai/en/docs/guide/concepts/mvote), or if the Toloker makes too many mistakes in [control tasks](https://toloka.ai/en/docs/guide/concepts/goldenset). Tasks completed by such Tolokers can be [given to other Tolokers](https://toloka.ai/en/docs/guide/concepts/restore-task-overlap).
