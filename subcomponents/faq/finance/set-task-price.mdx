<Cut title="Where can I set or change the task price?">

The task price is set up in the pool. Open the pool editing page and find the **Price** section.

The price is set up for a task suite. If the suite contains 10 tasks, the price in that section is set for labeling the entire suite.

Please note that the minimum price per task suite is $0.005. Therefore, if you want to change the task price, you need to change the number of tasks per suite.
