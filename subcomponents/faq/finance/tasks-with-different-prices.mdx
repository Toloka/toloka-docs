<Cut title="Can there be tasks with different prices in the pool?">

No. The price per task suite is the same for all tasks in the pool. You can create multiple pools with different prices or [change the price](https://toloka.ai/en/docs/guide/concepts/dynamic-pricing) depending on the Toloker skill using **Dynamic pricing**. You can [pay rewards](https://toloka.ai/en/docs/guide/concepts/bonus) to good Tolokers.
