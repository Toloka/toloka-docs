<Cut title="How do I set up a budget for my first task in Toloka?">

Here's the general rule of pricing: the more time is needed to complete the task, the higher the price is.

If the task is simple, like if the Toloker spends a few seconds to assess product relevance, then set the price to $0.01–$0.02 for 10 tasks (products) on the page.

If you register in Toloka as a Toloker, you can compare offers from other requesters.

Define the page price, multiply it by the overlap (it's usually 3–5 for a classification task) and add 20% VAT. Try topping up your account by $10 first, then continue topping it up based on the performance dynamics.
