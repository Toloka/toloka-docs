<Cut title="How long does paying the invoice take?">

If you pay using a bank card, the money is usually transferred to your Toloka account within a few minutes. If you can't see the top-up amount on your account, [write to us](/docs-new/guide/troubleshooting/support) and we'll sort it out. Specify your requester username and account number and use **Account top-up** as your email subject.
