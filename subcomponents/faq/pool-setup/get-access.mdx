<Cut title="Can one Toloker get access to two pools in the same project? Can I avoid that?">

Yes, if they can access both pools, they can do both of them. To restrict access to subsequent tasks for a Toloker, use the [Completed tasks](https://toloka.ai/en/docs/guide/concepts/submitted-answers) rule and select a ban at the project level.
