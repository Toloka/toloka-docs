<Cut title="Can I use a skill beyond a particular pool or project and apply it to other projects as well?">

Yes, of course â€” you can use the same skill for different projects. But most often, a skill is intended for a specific project. If the Toloker completes a certain task well, this doesn't mean that they will complete other ones successfully. Another disadvantage is that if you filter by skills that were set long ago, you will artificially limit the number of available Tolokers.
