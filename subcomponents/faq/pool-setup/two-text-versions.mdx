<Cut title="I have two text versions that I want to show to my respondents: one version to half of the audience, and another version to the other half (like in A/B testing). Is this possible in Toloka, or do I need to create two separate projects?">

If you pass texts to the input data, you can load 2 different tasks in the pool. In one task, pass Text 1 in the `INPUT: <input field name>` field, and in the other task, use this field to pass Text 2. But if the text is in the HTML block of the task template, you need to clone the project. To let a Toloker do only one task in your project, use the [Submitted responses](https://toloka.ai/en/docs/guide/concepts/submitted-answers) rule. You can assign a skill or ban the Toloker after they submit one response.
