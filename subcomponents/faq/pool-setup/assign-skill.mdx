<Cut title="Are there any easy ways to assign a certain Toloker a skill in Toloka, even if the Toloker didn't do any tasks (like I can do in the Sandbox)?">

In the main Toloka version, you can only assign a skill to Tolokers who have completed at least one of your tasks. There is no option to assign a skill to an arbitrary user. To limit the audience of Tolokers who will see your project, use [filters](/docs-new/guide/filters). For example, specify the city, date of birth, gender, or some other parameters of your target Tolokers.
