<Cut title="I want to calculate a skill based on performance in multiple projects. Is that possible? If it is, can I use “Aggregation by skill”?">

If you mean multiple different projects, you can't do that.

You can merge all the projects into one and use **History size** in the quality control rules. See examples in the [Control tasks](/docs-new/guide/goldenset) post.

You can use **Aggregation by skill**, but you'll need to list all the possible values, which is probably not the best choice. Perhaps you'll find [another method of aggregation](/docs-new/guide/result-aggregation) helpful.
