<Cut title="If I ban a Toloker for doing my tasks too fast, will all their responses be deleted and given to other Tolokers for labeling?">

No. The responses of these Tolokers aren't automatically excluded from the final results file.

But you can do it yourself if you want. When downloading the results, select the option **Exclude assignments by banned Tolokers** to delete the responses of Tolokers who were banned at the moment of downloading. You can also forward all the assignments from banned Tolokers to other Tolokers using the [Re-completion of assignments from banned users](/docs-new/guide/restore-task-overlap) rule.
