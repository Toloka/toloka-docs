<Cut title="Isn't the exam a regular pool that I pay for? How does it differ from a regular pool?">

An exam pool contains only control tasks. It's usually small and used for checking how well Tolokers learned to do your tasks after they read the instructions and completed the [training](https://toloka.ai/en/docs/guide/concepts/additionals-q#selection). Unlike your main pool, you already know the correct responses for every task in this pool. You can set the price to zero.

Based on the results of responses to control tasks, you can assign a skill to the Tolokers and then specify it in the main pool as a filter. For example, `MySkill = 80 or = Is missing`. You don't have to create an exam. For simple tasks, the training pool provides enough practice, but many requesters also use exams.
