<Cut title="How can I speed up the pool completion?">

- To motivate Tolokers, assign a [public skill](/docs/guide/nav-create#public) and use [dynamic pricing](/docs/guide/dynamic-pricing).

- Try to [increase the project rating](/docs/guide/project_rating_stat), so that your task is higher in the list of tasks for Tolokers.

- Adjust the [quality-speed ratio](/docs/guide/adjust).

- Set a higher [priority](/docs/guide/pool_poolparams#priority) for the pool among other project pools.
