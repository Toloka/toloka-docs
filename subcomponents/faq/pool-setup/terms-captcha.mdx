<Cut title="I found the following terms related to captcha in Help: “Percentage of correct responses” and “Percentage of incorrect responses”. Are they determined from the control sample?">

The percentage of correct responses is based on the total number of captchas processed by the Toloker within the “range” specified in the **Recent control task responses to use** field. If the value is empty, the percentage is calculated using all the captchas that are shown for the tasks in the pool which uses the captcha rule.
