<Cut title="Can I change overlap after the pool is started?">

Yes. [Open edit mode for the pool](https://toloka.ai/en/docs/guide/concepts/pool-edit) and set a new overlap value. You don't need to restart the pool. Updating the settings is usually fast, but if there are many tasks, it may take several minutes.
