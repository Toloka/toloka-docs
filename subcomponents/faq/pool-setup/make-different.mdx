<Cut title="Can I make my training or control tasks totally different from the general tasks?">

Your [training](/docs-new/guide/train) and control tasks have the same project specification. However, you can create a separate project with the tasks and assign a skill based on Toloker responses. Then you can admit Tolokers to the main project based on their skill.
