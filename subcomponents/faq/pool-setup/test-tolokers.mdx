<Cut title="How do I test Tolokers to determine which kinds of tasks they do better and assign them relevant tasks?">

You can add a [training pool](https://toloka.ai/en/docs/guide/concepts/train) to test your Tolokers. Based on the test results, assign skills to the Tolokers for the tasks they do best.

Then open your pools only to the Tolokers that have a certain skill: use [filters](https://toloka.ai/en/docs/guide/concepts/filters) for this.
