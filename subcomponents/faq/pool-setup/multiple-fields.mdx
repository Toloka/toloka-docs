<Cut title="My task uses a form with multiple fields. When there is an overlap and “Majority vote” is used for quality control, is each field taken into account, or if one field mismatches the majority vote, are the task results considered incorrect?">

All responses to the task are taken into account. If one response differs from the majority vote, the whole task is counted as mismatching the responses of other Tolokers.
