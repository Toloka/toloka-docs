<Cut title="The pool has an overlap and majority vote set up, but some fraudulent Toloker opens the task suites, does nothing, and submits empty assignments. Could this cheater get more tasks from the pool before the results of other Tolokers are known? Could a Toloker quickly click through a lot of task suites before the majority vote is accumulated to ban the cheater?">

Yes, unfortunately, this can happen. This is why we recommend that you offer a training task or exam before the general task. In this case, only those people who showed good performance at the previous stage are selected for the main pool.
