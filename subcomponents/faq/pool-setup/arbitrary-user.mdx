<Cut title="Can I add an arbitrary Toloker as a Toloker?">

If the Toloker mismatches your preset filter, they can't see the task. You can only remove the restricting filter from the pool. You can test the task in the [Sandbox](https://toloka.ai/en/docs/guide/concepts/sandbox) by adding the desired Toloker to your trusted list.
