<Cut title="I set up a rule to ban Tolokers after the first incorrect captcha. This is to eliminate any bots. Is this too strict? What rule do most projects use?">

Indeed, this rule is probably too strict. Even the most careful Toloker can make a mistake, so you probably want to relax the rule. Besides the requester-specific bans, we have system processes that ban Tolokers who regularly fail captcha checks in Toloka.
