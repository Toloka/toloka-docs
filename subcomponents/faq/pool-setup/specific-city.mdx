<Cut title="Can I select Tolokers from a specific city of residence or is the only option “Region by IP”?">

Yes, you can do that. In the [filters](/docs-new/guide/filters), select **Profile → City**. Please note that the profile data is entered by the Toloker when they register in Toloka. We recommended that you use the filters **Region by phone number** and **Region by IP**.
