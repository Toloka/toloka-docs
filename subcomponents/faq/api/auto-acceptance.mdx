<Cut title="Is it possible to automate the acceptance of the results? For example, I had a task where I asked Tolokers to upload a video. I want to reject all the results if nothing uploaded or the uploaded file is not video.">

There is the [accept](/docs/api/accept) method in the [API](/docs/api/) to accept or reject submitted task suites.
