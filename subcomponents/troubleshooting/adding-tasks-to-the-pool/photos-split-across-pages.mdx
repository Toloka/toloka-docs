<Cut title="I have a task for photo classification. When there are more than 5 photos on the page, why does Toloka split them across 2 pages?">

Toloka will split the links to images in the uploaded file into task suites depending on the method you specified when uploading the file. For more information, see the [Guide](https://toloka.ai/en/docs/guide/concepts/distribute-tasks-by-pages).
