### Errors in column headers

If the [column headings](/docs/guide/pool_csv) are incorrect, the whole file is rejected. Otherwise, Toloka specifies the number of tasks with processing errors.

### Processing errors tables

```json
"parsing_error_of": "https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/wsdm2020/photos/2d5f63a3184919ce7e3e7068cf93da4b.jpg\t\t",
"exception_msg": "the nameMapping array and the sourceList should be the same size (nameMapping length = 1, sourceList size = 3)"

**Extra tabs.**<br/><br/>If the uploaded file contains more `\t` column separators after the data or the link than the number of columns set in the [input data](/docs/glossary#input-output-data), you get an error message.<br/><br/>For example, if 1 column is set in the input data, and two more `\t\t` tabs are added in the file after the link, you get 3 columns, 2 of which are excessive. | Remove extra column separators in the above example — both `\t\t` characters.

```json
"exception_msg": "the nameMapping array and the sourceList should be the same size (nameMapping length = 4, sourceList size = 6)"
