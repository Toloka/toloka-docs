<Cut title="Why do double quotes disappear from the output if I try to escape them using quotation marks?">

If you have one word enclosed in quotes, format the uploaded assignment like this: `"How many letters are there in the word ""Liechtenstein"""`. If you are escaping quotes inside your text, then the entire text must be enclosed in quotes. For more information, see the [Escaping](https://toloka.ai/en/docs/guide/concepts/pool_csv#string) section.
