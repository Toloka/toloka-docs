<Cut title="The results include the responses of Tolokers who I banned">

The results show the responses of all Tolokers, including those who are banned. To exclude their responses from the results, select the option **Exclude assignments by banned Tolokers**. It will delete the responses from Tolokers who were banned at the moment the results were downloaded, not when the pool was labeled.
