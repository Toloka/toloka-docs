<Cut title="I add tasks to the pool via the create task method, but tasks are not created. What is the reason?">

You can upload tasks with the help of [create task](/docs-new/api/create-task) method to the pool that uses smart mixing only. If you want to use a pool without smart mixing, use the [create task suite](/docs-new/api/create-task-suite) method.
