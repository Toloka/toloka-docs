<Cut title="I created a project and a pool, but the Next button doesn't work or the preview shows a blank screen.">

Toloka lets you know that something is wrong with the project. The blank screen often appears when there are errors in the [task interface](/docs-new/glossary#task-interface), including the JavaScript code. The **Next** button may be disabled if the output specification lacks some field or contains invalid values, or if, for example, you configured validation for a nonexistent field in JavaScript.
