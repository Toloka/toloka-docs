<Cut title="I want to create an exam with three tasks. If a Toloker does two out of three tasks correctly, they get the skill. So I try to use `3` in the **Recent control task responses to use** field, but I get an error that the value is too small. Can I get around this without increasing the number of tasks to five?">

The **Recent control task responses to use** field is for the number of recent responses from the Toloker. If you use manual review for your task, then to set up your intended rule you need to specify `3` in **Total reviewed responses**.
