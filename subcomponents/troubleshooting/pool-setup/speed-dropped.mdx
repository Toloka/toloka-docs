<Cut title="Why has the speed of pool completion dropped?">

Possible reasons:

- You've stopped the [main pool](/docs-new/glossary#training-pool). This could limit the number of Tolokers with access to the pool. Start the training pool again. There will be more Tolokers who can access the tasks.

- The filters you set are too strict. For example, a strong restriction on a certain skill that most Tolokers don't have.

- Too many Tolokers are banned. Ease the quality control rules.
