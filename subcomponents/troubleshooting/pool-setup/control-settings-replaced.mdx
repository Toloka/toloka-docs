<Cut title="I set up quality control, then I copied my Toloker requirements. All my quality control settings were deleted and replaced with the copied settings. Is that normal?">

Yes. When you copy the filter and quality control settings, the settings you previously added manually are overwritten. You should see a warning about this in the copy settings window.
