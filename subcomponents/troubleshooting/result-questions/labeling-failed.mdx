<Cut title="What should I do if the labeling process failed?">

If the labeling process failed for one reason or another, contact [support](https://toloka.ai/en/docs/guide/troubleshooting/support). Go to the tab for control tasks or to the pool page and click **Contact us**. After the problem is solved, you'll be able to order the labeling of control tasks again.
