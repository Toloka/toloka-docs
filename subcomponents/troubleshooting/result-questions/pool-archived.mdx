<Cut title="What should I do if I want to accept a completed task but the pool is already archived or the Toloker wrote to me after the allowed time?">

Simply [give the Toloker a separate reward](https://toloka.ai/en/docs/guide/concepts/bonus) without changing the task status. You can't change the task status in the pool in this case.
