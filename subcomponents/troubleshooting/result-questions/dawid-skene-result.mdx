<Cut title="Why does the Dawid-Skene aggregation model return a result that the Tolokers didn't select?">

The method doesn't guarantee that original Toloker responses will be used for aggregation. The algorithm takes into account Tolokers' quality parameters and response patterns. Consequently, it can return a result that's different from the Tolokers' responses to this task.
