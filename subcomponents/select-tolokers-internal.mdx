<Cut title="Exclude those who haven't used Toloka for a long time.">

Turn on the **Show active users** option and specify the number of days when the Toloker completed at least one task.

<Cut title="Find those who opened or completed my tasks">

In the left part of the window use the **Project** and **Pool** fields to select Tolokers who opened tasks in one of your projects or pools.

On the pool statistics page, these Tolokers are listed in the **Interested in pool** field.

The **Completed** field shows the number of completed tasks. If the number is `0`, it means the Toloker only opened a task but didn't complete it.
