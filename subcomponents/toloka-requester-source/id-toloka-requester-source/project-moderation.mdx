## Project moderation {#moderation}

<Note mode="warning" title="Warning">

Before launching the project, see the [What tasks can't be placed in Toloka?](https://toloka.ai/en/docs/guide/concepts/unwanted) page.

</Note>

Moderation begins when you launch the first pool of a new project in which the pools have not been started before.

This usually takes about 1 hour. In some cases, the moderation process may take longer. Note that tasks are not available to Tolokers during moderation. Once it's finished, you'll get a message with the results.

If your project successfully passes moderation and you didn't pause the pool, Tolokers will start your tasks.

Otherwise, you'll see the **Your project didn't pass moderation** label under the project name. In this case, you won't be able to launch pools and Tolokers won't see tasks from the project.

If your project is rejected, press the **Contact support** button on the pool page or on the project page to find out why and get specific recommendations.

Use the recommendations to fix the task content and let us know when it's ready to check. If everything is OK, your project will be approved, and Tolokers will be able to start your tasks. If not, we'll tell you what else you need to do. Also you can [clone](https://toloka.ai/en/docs/guide/concepts/project#clone) the rejected project, make changes and launch it again.
