Specify the pool description which will be displayed instead of the project description in the task list for Tolokers. By default, Tolokers see the description from the project settings. To use a different description, uncheck the **Use project description** box and set **Public description**. If necessary, click **+ Private comment** to add a private project description that only you will see.
