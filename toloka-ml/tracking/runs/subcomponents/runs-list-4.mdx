You can't delete a run from the UI. However, you can invalidate it.

To invalidate runs, select them using the option to the left of their ID. Next, click **Invalidate** at the bottom left in the menu that opens. The runs you selected get tagged as `__invalidated__` and will no longer be displayed in the list on the homepage, as well as in charts and tables.

To restore the invalidated runs, select the `__invalidated__` tag in the **Tags** field in the search menu at the top. You can select the runs found using the option to the right of their ID. Next, click **Restore** at the bottom left in the menu that opens. This restores the runs and removes their `__invalidated__` tag.
