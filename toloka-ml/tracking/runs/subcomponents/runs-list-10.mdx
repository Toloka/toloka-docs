To compare multiple runs by their metrics:

1. Open the [Toloka ML platform](https://tolokamodels.tech/) homepage.
2. Select the desired runs using the option to the left of their ID.
3. Click **Diff** at the bottom left in the menu that opens. You'll be redirected to the [Diff Tool](https://tolokamodels.tech/diff) page where you can compare the runs.

The **Metrics** section shows the metrics broken down by name and slice.
