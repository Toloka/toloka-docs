# clone_project
`toloka.async_client.client.AsyncTolokaClient.clone_project` | [Source code](https://github.com/Toloka/toloka-kit/blob/v1.1.3/src/async_client/client.py#L0)

```python
async clone_project(
    self,
    project_id: str,
    reuse_controllers: bool = True
)
```

Synchronously clones the project, all pools and trainings

Emulates cloning behavior via Toloka interface:
- the same skills will be used
- the same quality control collectors will be used (could be changed by `reuse_controllers=False`)
- the expiration date will not be changed in the new project
- etc.

Doesn't have transaction - can clone project, and then raise on cloning pool.
Doesn't copy tasks/golden tasks/training tasks.

## Parameters Description

| Parameters | Type | Description |
| :----------| :----| :-----------|
`project_id`|**str**|<p>ID of the project to be cloned.</p>
`reuse_controllers`|**bool**|<p>Use same quality controllers in cloned and created projects. Defaults to `True`. This means that all quality control rules will be applied to both projects. For example, if you have rule &quot;fast_submitted_count&quot;, fast responses counts across both projects.</p>

* **Returns:**

  All created objects project, pools and trainings.

* **Return type:**

  [CloneResults](/docs/toloka-kit/reference/toloka.client.clone_results.CloneResults)

**Examples:**

```python
project, pools, trainings = toloka_client.clone_project('123')
# add tasks in pools and trainings
```
