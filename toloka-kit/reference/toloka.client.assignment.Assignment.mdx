## Parameters Description

| Parameters | Type | Description |
| :----------| :----| :-----------|
`id`|**Optional\[str\]**|<p>The ID of the assignment.</p>
`task_suite_id`|**Optional\[str\]**|<p>The ID of the assigned task suite.</p>
`pool_id`|**Optional\[str\]**|<p>The ID of the pool containing the task suite.</p>
`user_id`|**Optional\[str\]**|<p>The ID of the Toloker who was assigned the task suite.</p>
`status`|**Optional\[[Status](/docs/toloka-kit/reference/toloka.client.assignment.Assignment.Status)\]**|<p>Status of the assignment.</p> <ul> <li>`ACTIVE` — The task suite is assigned but it isn&#x27;t completed yet.</li> <li>`SUBMITTED` — The task suite is completed but it isn&#x27;t checked.</li> <li>`ACCEPTED` — The task suite is accepted by the requester.</li> <li>`REJECTED` — The task suite is rejected by the requester.</li> <li>`SKIPPED` — The task suite is skipped by the Toloker.</li> <li>`EXPIRED` — Time for completing the tasks has expired.</li> </ul>
`reward`|**Optional\[Decimal\]**|<p>Payment received by the Toloker.</p>
`bonus_ids`|**Optional\[List\[str\]\]**|<p>IDs of rewards issued for the task.</p>
`tasks`|**Optional\[List\[[Task](/docs/toloka-kit/reference/toloka.client.task.Task)\]\]**|<p>Data for the tasks.</p>
`automerged`|**Optional\[bool\]**|<p>Flag of the response received as a result of merging identical tasks. Value:</p> <ul> <li>`True` — The response was recorded when identical tasks were merged.</li> <li>`False` — Normal Toloker response.</li> </ul>
`created`|**Optional\[datetime\]**|<p>The date and time when the task suite was assigned to a Toloker.</p>
`submitted`|**Optional\[datetime\]**|<p>The date and time when the task suite was completed by a Toloker.</p>
`accepted`|**Optional\[datetime\]**|<p>The date and time when the responses for the task suite were accepted by the requester.</p>
`rejected`|**Optional\[datetime\]**|<p>The date and time when the responses for the task suite were rejected by the requester.</p>
