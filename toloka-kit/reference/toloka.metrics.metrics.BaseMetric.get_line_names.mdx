# get_line_names
`toloka.metrics.metrics.BaseMetric.get_line_names` | [Source code](https://github.com/Toloka/toloka-kit/blob/v1.1.3/src/metrics/metrics.py#L128)

```python
get_line_names(self)
```

Returns a list of metric names that can be generated by this class instance.

For example, if a class can generate 5 metrics, but some instance generate only 3 of them,
this method will return a list with exactly 3 strings. If you call 'get_metrics' on this instance,
it could return from 0 to 3 metrics.
