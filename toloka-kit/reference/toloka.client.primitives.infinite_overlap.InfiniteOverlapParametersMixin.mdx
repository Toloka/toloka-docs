# InfiniteOverlapParametersMixin
`toloka.client.primitives.infinite_overlap.InfiniteOverlapParametersMixin` | [Source code](https://github.com/Toloka/toloka-kit/blob/v1.1.4/src/client/primitives/infinite_overlap.py#L6)

```python
InfiniteOverlapParametersMixin(
    self,
    infinite_overlap=None,
    overlap=None
)
```

This mixin provides `overlap` and `infinite_overlap` attributes

and is responsible for maintaining their consistency.

Possible states:
* `overlap` is `None` and `infinite_overlap` is `None`:
    Interpreted as "overlap was not provided"
* `overlap` is `None` and `infinite_overlap` is `True`:
    Interpreted as "infinite overlap"
* `overlap` is not `None` and `infinite_overlap` is `False`:
    Interpreted as "finite overlap of `overlap`"

All other states are considered invalid
