# Change task overlap

_Increase the overlap of a task when you need more Tolokers to complete it._

## Steps to follow

<Import/>

<Instantiate/>

### 3. Change task overlap {#step-three}

[Find out](/docs/toloka-kit/recipes/get-tasks) the ID of the task which you want to modify. Then change the task overlap calling the `patch_task()` method.

<CodeCopy
  isSmall
  theme="light"
  code={
    <HighlightChildren language="python">
      task = toloka_client.<Term term="patch_task"><PatchTask/></Term>('00022da5a7--6388b40547c84000494cdc5a', overlap=5)
    </HighlightChildren>
  }
  textToCopy={`task = toloka_client.patch_task('00022da5a7--6388b40547c84000494cdc5a', overlap=5)`}
/>

### 4. Display resulting task overlap {#step-four}

The `patch_task()` request will return the [Task](/docs/toloka-kit/reference/toloka.client.task.Task) class object. You can use its attributes to print the information you need.

```python
print(task.id, task.overlap)
```

You should get an output with the task ID and modified overlap which looks like this.

```bash
00022da5a7--6388b40547c84000494cdc5a 5
```

## Complete code: Change task overlap {#complete-code}

```python
import toloka.client as toloka

toloka_client = toloka.TolokaClient('AQC2AGAJgyNSA8CtpdO9MWy_QEB6s6kDjHUoElE', 'PRODUCTION')

task = toloka_client.patch_task('00022da5a7--6388b40547c84000494cdc5a', overlap=5)
print(task.id, task.overlap)
```
