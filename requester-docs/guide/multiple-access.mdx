# Shared access to the account

You can give access to your account to the following user categories:

- **Toloka requesters with social authorization**

    Give access to your account to other clients who are [registered in Toloka](/docs/guide/access) as requesters using social authorization.

- **SSO clients**

    Give access to other clients who use the same [SSO authentication](/docs/guide/sso/authentication) as you to access Toloka.

- **Toloka support**

    If you need help with setting up pools or projects, give [Toloka support](/docs/guide/troubleshooting/support) temporary view-only access to your account to get recommendations. Access will be automatically revoked in 7 days. If necessary, you can revoke access earlier.

## Access types

Toloka allows you to give two types of access to your account:

- **Full access**

    Use it if you want other people manage your projects and post tasks, and you will manage the finances.

- **View-only access**

    Use it if you don't want to give full access to your account, but want them to view the account information. You can also give view-only access to Toloka support to help you with your projects or troubleshoot the problems you have.

The main differences between the access types are listed in the table below.

Permissions | Full access | View-only access
----------- | :---------: | :--------------:
View projects, pools, tasks, finance information | + | +
[Manage projects](/docs/guide/project) | + | -
[Manage pools](/docs/guide/pool) | + | -
[Post tasks](/docs/guide/task_upload) | + | -
[Get results](/docs/guide/result-of-eval) | + | -
Manage access to account | + | -
Use [Toloka API](https://toloka.ai/docs/api/api-reference/) | + | -
Move tasks from [sandbox](/docs/guide/sandbox) to Toloka production version | + | -
[Top up balance](/docs/guide/refill) | - | -

You can view the list of accounts to which the permissions have been granted on the **Profile** page in the [Account access](https://platform.toloka.ai/requester/profile/access) tab.
