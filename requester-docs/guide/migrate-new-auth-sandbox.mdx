# Migrating to new social authorization in Toloka sandbox

If you have previously registered in the sandbox using an email address, you need to confirm it or connect another social account to continue using the sandbox. You can connect a single social account or choose to connect them all to your sandbox profile and use any of them to sign in to the sandbox.

## Connecting social accounts `{#connect-account}`

Log in to the sandbox using the [legacy login page](https://sandbox.toloka.yandex.com/). Then follow the steps below to connect a new social account to your sandbox profile.

<Tabs tabs={[
  { title: 'In the popup window', value: <MigrateNewAuthSandboxList1/> },
  { title: 'In the settings', value: <MigrateNewAuthSandboxList2/> },
]}/>
