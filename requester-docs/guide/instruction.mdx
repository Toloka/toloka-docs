# Writing instructions

When selecting a task, the Toloker is first shown the instructions that you wrote. Describe what needs to be done and give examples in them.

## Why instructions are important {#section_fj5_tl3_bnb}

Good instructions help the Toloker complete the task correctly. The clarity and completeness of the instructions affect response quality and the [project's rating](/docs/guide/project_rating_stat). Unclear or overly complex instructions, on the contrary, will scare off Tolokers.

If the Toloker completed the task according to the instructions, and you rejected it, they can file an appeal. It is important to make the instructions both clear and accurate.

Learn more about how to write simple and clear instructions on the [Toloka](https://toloka.ai/knowledgebase/instruction) website.

## Creating instructions {#create}

Write text, format it, and insert pictures, links and tables in the visual editor or using [HTML markup](#html). To switch modes, click <img src="https://tlk-infra-front.azureedge.net/portal-static/uploaded/images/1675425172020/1675425172020_original_svg.svg" alt="" />.

To expand the editor to full screen, click <img src="https://tlk-infra-front.azureedge.net/portal-static/uploaded/images/1675425172445/1675425172445_original_svg.svg" alt="" />.

To view the instructions as seen by the Toloker, click <img src="https://tlk-infra-front.azureedge.net/portal-static/uploaded/images/1675425171099/1675425171099_original_svg.svg" alt="" />.

## HTML markup {#html}

The HTML markup mode allows you to create user-friendly instructions. Declare and apply [CSS styles](#css) and use [allowed HTML tags](#html-yes).

#### CSS styles {#css}

Declare styles in the `style` container or use the `style` attribute in tags to assign a style.

<Note mode="note" title="Note">

The `style` container can be placed at the beginning or at the end of the instructions.

</Note>

#### Supported HTML tags

The HTML markup supports basic tags:

- Headers from `h1` to `h6`.
- Paragraph `p` and the `div`, `pre`, and `blockquote` blocks.
- The `ol`, `ul`, and `dl` lists.
- The `table` tag for tables.
- The `a` tag for links.
- The `img` and `map` pictures.
- Text layout. For example: `span`, `strong`, `em`.

`a`|`col`|`h1`|`img`|`span`|`td`

#### Unsupported HTML tags

You can't insert the following in the instructions:

- Scripts.
- Frames.
- Objects, audio players, or video players (the `object`, `audio` and `video` elements).

    <Note mode="tip" title="Tip">

    You can provide links to audio and video.

    </Note>

Tags that are not supported are removed from the instructions when saving the [project](/docs/glossary#project).

## Editing the instructions {#edit}

To change the instructions, go to project editing, make changes and save the project.

<Note mode="note" title="Note">

If you edit instructions in a project that already has completed tasks, you should [notify Tolokers](/docs/guide/qa-assign).

</Note>

## Troubleshooting {#troubleshooting}

<Cut title="How do I show my instructions to the Toloker inside the task so that they don't need to open or close it?">

There are three options:

- Put your instructions inside the task, but make sure that it doesn't clutter the interface.
- Use a side window for your instructions so that the Toloker can quickly expand or collapse them.
- Hide the instructions in an expandable section or add hints for the individual interface elements.

For best results, we recommend that you pre-select the Tolokers that meet your requirements and set up the quality control rules.
