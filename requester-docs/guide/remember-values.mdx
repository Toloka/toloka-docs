# “Remember values” parameter

Some quality control rules have the parameter which allows to calculate Toloker's responses from other pools. It sets the dynamic window, which the values are recalculated within. Depending on the rule, the dynamic window is measured:

- In tasks: the [Review results](/docs/guide/reviewing-assignments) and [Majority vote](/docs/guide/mvote) rules, the **Recent tasks to use** field.

- In [control tasks](/docs/glossary#control-task): the [Control tasks](/docs/guide/goldenset) rule, the **Recent control and training task responses to use** field.

- In [task suites](/docs/glossary#task-suite): the [Fast responses](/docs/guide/quick-answers) rule, the **Recent task suites to use** field.

## How it works `{#how-field-works}`

The <Term term="parameter">The parameter which allows to calculate Toloker's responses from other pools</Term> works the same way for all rules.

Let's see how this parameter works with the [Control tasks](/docs/guide/goldenset) rule. Go to the project or [pool](/docs/glossary#pool) settings and select this quality control rule.

In our example, the <Term term="parameter">The parameter which allows to calculate Toloker's responses from other pools</Term> is set in the **Recent control and training task responses to use** field.

<Tabs tabs={[
  { title: 'The field is not filled in', value: <RememberValuesList1/> },
  { title: 'The field is filled in', value: <RememberValuesList2/> },
]}/>

<Note mode="restriction" title="Important">

- If you have previously filled in the **Recent control and training task responses to use** field, you can't change it to empty. But you can delete the rule and create a new one.

- All rules work independently, even if they are united by one entity.

</Note>

## How to clear the Toloker's response history `{#clear-history}`

The Toloker's response history will be cleared under the following conditions:

- Ban — within the dynamic window if the **Recent control and training task responses to use** field is filled in, or within the entire pool if the field is not filled in.

- Pause on pool — within the entire pool if the field is not filled in.

When the ban or pause is lifted and the Toloker starts performing tasks, the calculation will start again without taking into account previously completed tasks.

<Note mode="restriction" title="Alert">

Only the history of the rule which triggered the ban will be cleared.
