To remove a skill from a Toloker using Toloka API, send a `DELETE` request with the specified ID of the skill you want to remove that is assigned to the "skill-Toloker" pair:

```bash
curl -X DELETE 'https://toloka.dev/api/v1/user-skills/54116339' \
     -H 'Authorization: ApiKey PlaceYourRealApiKey_Here'
```
