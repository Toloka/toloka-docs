# Recompletion of assignments from banned users

Use this rule if the Toloker was banned and you want someone else to complete their tasks.

<Note mode="note" title="Note">

Don't use this rule in [pools](/docs/glossary#pool) with [dynamic overlap](/docs/guide/dynamic-overlap). This increases the maximum [overlap](/docs/glossary#overlap) value.

</Note>

## When to use {#when-use}

<Note mode="restriction" title="Alert">

This rule can increase the cost of the pool.

</Note>

Use the rule if you want to get responses only from honest Tolokers to each task in the given overlap.

The assignments submitted by banned Tolokers will be taken into account if they are not rejected manually using [manual review](/docs/glossary#assignment-review). They can be reassigned by setting up the corresponding rule.

To download the responses of users who are not blocked:

1. On the pool page, click **Download results** on the right.

1. Click **Additional options**.

1. Turn off the **Include responses from banned Tolokers** option.

1. Click **Download**.

Don't use it if:

- You don't want to increase the overlap for tasks.
- You don't want the final budget for pool labeling to exceed the initial budget.
- You set up [dynamic overlap](/docs/guide/dynamic-overlap). This increases the maximum overlap value.

## How to configure {#rule}

<Note mode="restriction" title="Alert">

All fields in this rule are required. If you don't fill in at least one of them, you won't be able to save the rule.

</Note>

**Field** | **Overview**
----- | -----
**If** | <RestoreTaskOverlapTable1/>
**then** | <RestoreTaskOverlapTable2/>

## Examples {#examples}

Task: classify photos for a dataset across different categories. If a Toloker is banned by a quality control rule (for example, [fast resposes](/docs/guide/quick-answers)) or no longer matches the skill, their responses aren't counted and their tasks are sent for re-completion to another Toloker.
