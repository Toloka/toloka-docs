# Where to store files

If your task requires images, audio, or video files, you can upload them:
- Directly [from your device](#media-files). Use this way if there is only a single `URL` type input field in the [specification](/docs/guide/incoming).

- To [photo hosting](#image-hosting). Use it if you need less than 10 images (for example, for task [instructions](/docs/glossary#instructions) or for testing a [pool](/docs/glossary#pool)).

- To [cloud storage](#cloud). Use it if you need to add more then 10 images, audio, or video files.



{/* ## Uploading media files directly `{#media-files}`

Upload media files from your device to avoid difficulties with placing links in the [file with tasks](/docs/glossary#tsv).

When you're uploading tasks to the pool, click **Select media files** and choose files.

Features:

- This option is available only for the projects that have a single `URL` type input field in the specification.

- After uploading, tasks are automatically created with links to the uploaded files.

<Note mode="note" title="Note">

Supported file formats:

- Images — GIF, JPG, JPEG, PNG, WebP.
- Audio — FLAC, MP3, WAV, M4A.
- Video — MP4.

</Note> */}



## Photo hosting `{#image-hosting}`

Some photo hosting services are free and don't require registration. This way you can quickly and easily upload your files and get links to them. But they have limitations. We recommend that you read the terms of use before using photo hosting services.

<Note mode="note" title="Note">

The information about the terms is provided here for informational purposes.

The terms may be changed by the service unilaterally. You can view changes on the photo hosting website.

Toloka is not responsible for such changes or for placing them in this section within a certain timeframe.

</Note>

### How to upload an image to photo hosting

## Cloud storage `{#cloud}`
In Object Storage terms, files and folders are _objects_. All objects are stored in buckets. A _bucket_ is a logical entity that helps organize object storage.

Cloud storage enables users to store large amounts of data. You need to pay to use it. To try out a service, use a free trial.

<Note mode="note" title="Note">

The information about the terms is provided for informational purposes.

The terms of use and rates may be changed unilaterally by the service. You can view changes on the cloud storage website.

----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | -----
[Amazon S3](/docs/guide/amazon-cloud-storage) | 12 months | 5 GB | — | [Free access level](https://aws.amazon.com/free)

## Creating a file with tasks `{#tsv-create}`

To use a file in the task interface, you should have a field of **URL** type in your project's [input data](/docs/guide/incoming). You'll need the name of this field later when creating a file.

In the [file with the tasks](/docs/guide/pool_csv), paste the links into the column that matches the input data field to which this data is passed.

For example, if you want to use images in the `image` field, specify the file links in the `INPUT:image` column:

<Tabs tabs={[
  { title: 'Amazon S3', value: <CloudStorageList1/> },
  { title: 'Azure Blob Storage', value: <CloudStorageList2/> },
  { title: 'Google Cloud Storage', value: <CloudStorageList3/> },
]}/>
