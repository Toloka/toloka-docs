# Project rating

The [project](/docs/glossary#project) rating is the average score given to a project by Tolokers over the last 14 days. There are four evaluation categories:

1. The intention to complete similar tasks.
1. Clarity of [instructions](/docs/glossary#instructions).
1. Convenience of the [task interface](/docs/glossary#task-interface).
1. Communication with the requester.

The project rating is available to Tolokers. By default, the list of tasks is sorted by project rating.
