# How to edit tasks by yourself

You can turn a general task into a [control task](/docs/glossary#control-task) by adding the correct answer, or into a [training task](/docs/glossary#training-task) by adding the correct answer and a hint.

<Cut title="What makes a good hint?">

Avoid wordings like: “You answered incorrectly, please provide the correct response”. The Toloker learns when the hint explains the essence of their mistake.

Make the hints clear. Explain which response should be chosen and why.

</Cut>

<Note mode="restriction" title="Restriction">

Task markup is available only for [training pools](/docs/guide/train) and pools uploaded with [“smart mixing”](/docs/guide/distribute-tasks-by-pages#smart-mixing).

</Note>

## How do I mark up tasks? {#section_czh_fj2_ghb}

1. Make sure the pool isn't running.

1. Click either **Control tasks** or **Training tasks** indicator of the **Tasks** block on the pool page.

    <Image width="400px" withBackground imageId="1680169936872" alt="Click Control or Training tasks" />

1. Create a control or a training task from another type of task clicking the appropriate button.

    <Image withBackground imageId="1680169942389" alt="Create control or training tasks" />

1. Select the responses that should be checked. (The list of the [output data fields](/docs/guide/incoming) is on the right.)

1. Click **Save and go to next**.

<Cut title="Example of task markup">

In this example, the correct response is added for the control task. Only the choice in the `result` field is checked.

<Image withBackground imageId="1680169948345" alt="" />

</Cut>

## Improve the reliability of control tasks {#answer_distribution}

After you have created the control tasks, make sure that different variations of correct responses occur with the same frequency. This will help avoid random guessing in responses.

1. Go to the task markup page.

1. Open the **Training tasks → Distribution of correct responses for control tasks** tab.

    The distribution of responses is shown as a percentage.

<Note mode="tip" title="Tip">

When creating control tasks, enter only correct responses that answer the question. So for an image classification task, **Image loading error** is not a correct response that answers the task question.

</Note>

#### Example of response distribution

<Tabs tabs={[
  { title: 'Correct', value: <TaskMarkupByYourselfList1/> },
  { title: 'Incorrect', value: <TaskMarkupByYourselfList2/> },
]}/>

## How to edit tasks {#task-edit}

1. Make sure the pool isn't running.

1. Click **Edit** in the **Pool tasks** block.

1. Click the tab with the type of the task.

1. Find the task in the list and click <img src="https://tlk-infra-front.azureedge.net/portal-static/uploaded/images/1675425172884/1675425172884_original_svg.svg" alt="" /> . Editing mode opens.

## How to delete a task from the pool {#delete-task}

1. Make sure the pool isn't running.

1. Click **Edit** in the **Pool tasks** block.

1. Click the tab with the type of the task.

1. Find the task in the list and click <img src="https://tlk-infra-front.azureedge.net/portal-static/uploaded/images/1675425193044/1675425193044_original_svg.svg" alt="" />. You can also delete a task from the pool in [editing mode](#task-edit).

<Note mode="tip" title="Tip">

If you set the overlap to 0 [via the API](/docs/api/set-min-task-overlap), the task won't be visible to Tolokers, and you won't have to delete it.

</Note>
