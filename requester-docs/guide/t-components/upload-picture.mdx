# Button for image file upload

<Note mode="note" title="Note">

The task interface configuration guide describes the features of the HTML/JS/CSS editor. You can also try creating a button for uploading images in [Template Builder](/docs/template-builder/reference/field.media-file).

</Note>

To add an image upload button <img src="https://tlkfrontprod.azureedge.net/portal-production/static/uploaded/images/1675425180691/1675425180691_original_svg.svg" alt="" /> to the task, use the `{{field type= "file-img" name="<output field name> "sources="<sources parameter>" fileType="<fileType parameter>"}}`. After the image is uploaded the Toloker will see an icon for image preview. Example:

```plaintext
{{field type="file-img" name="photo" sources="CAMERA" fileType="IMAGE" camera=true}}
```

In the [output data](/docs/guide/incoming) description, add one of the fields:

- Field with the `file` type — for uploading one image only. Example:

    ```json
    {
    "result": {
    "type": "file",
    "required": true
    }
    }
    ```

- Field with the `array_file` type — for uploading several images at once. Example:

    ```json
    {
    "result": {
    "type": "array_file",
    "required": true
    }
    }
    ```
