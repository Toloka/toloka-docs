The requester has five tasks, each completed by five Tolokers. Each task has one output field with three response options.`Overlap = 3`. In this case, tasks 1, 3, and 5 match the threshold, but the other tasks are not included in the **majority vote** calculation.

The Tolokers will be assigned the following skills based on **majority vote**:

Toloker 1 | (1+0+1)/3=66% correct
----- | -----
Toloker 2 | (0+1+0)/3=33% correct
Toloker 3 | (1+0+1)/3= 66% correct
Toloker 4 | (0+1+0)/3=33% correct
Toloker 5 | (1+1+1)/3=100% correct
