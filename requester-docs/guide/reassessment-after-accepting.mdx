# Processing rejected and accepted assignments

You can enable the [manual review](/docs/guide/offline-accept) option to [reject or accept](/docs/guide/accept) assignments that Tolokers completed. Assignments are rejected and accepted on a page-by-page basis.

<Note mode="note" title="Note">

Once the review period in the **Review period in days** field runs out, tasks are accepted automatically.

</Note>

## When to use `{#when-use}`

This rule is helpful when you need to:
- Resend rejected assignments for re-completion to other Tolokers.

    If you rejected an assignment, you may want it to be completed by another Toloker instead of the one whose response you rejected. To do this, you can increase the [overlap](/docs/glossary#overlap) for this assignment only. This is especially helpful if you have the overlap value set to 1.

- Save money on re-completing assignments that you have already accepted.

    If you've reviewed and accepted a task, it may not make sense for other Tolokers to also complete it. To avoid this, you can reduce the overlap for accepted assignments only.

## How to configure `{#rule}`
<Note mode="warning" title="Warning">

All fields in this rule are required. If you don't fill in at least one of them, you won't be able to save the rule.
