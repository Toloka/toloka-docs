# Ban

Tolokers can be banned in two ways:

1. [By the requester](#ban-yourself).
1. [By the platform](#ban-platform).

## How to ban a Toloker {#ban-yourself}

You can block a Toloker's access to one or more [projects](/docs/glossary#project). This lets you control manually which Tolokers will complete tasks. For example, you can choose all Tolokers with a [skill](/docs/glossary#skill) value lower than N and block their access to tasks. You can also unblock access.

<Note mode="warning" title="Warning">

The assignments submitted by banned Tolokers will be taken into account if they are not rejected using manual review. They can be reassigned by setting up the [Recompletion of assignments from banned users](/docs/guide/restore-task-overlap) rule.

</Note>

## Banning on the platform {#ban-platform}

Toloka has dedicated [anti-fraud system](https://toloka.ai/anti-fraud/) for banning dishonest Tolokers. It monitors user behavior and blocks suspicious accounts.

The main reasons for banning:

1. Disclosure of confidential information.
1. Using scripts and bots or any form of cheating.
1. Poor response quality.
1. Providing false data during registration.
1. Frequently skipping captchas or entering them incorrectly.
1. Using multiple accounts.
1. Location cheating.

<Note mode="note" title="Note">

If a Toloker's behavior seems suspicious, [write to support](/docs/guide/troubleshooting/support?form-source=guide-ban#cheater). We'll conduct an additional review. If the Toloker is violating the user agreement, they'll be blocked in the system and will no longer be able to complete tasks.

You can also [ban](#ban) this Toloker from your project.
