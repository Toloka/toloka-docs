When you [clone a project](/docs/guide/project#clone), its quality control settings aren't transferred.

</Note>

Open the project page, open the **Quality control** tab and click **Set quality control**. Then click **+ Add Quality Control Rule**.

The rules are applied to all project pools, so you can't change settings in just one of the pools.
