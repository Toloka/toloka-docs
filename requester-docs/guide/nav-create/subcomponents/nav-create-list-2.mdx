To create a skill using Toloka API, send a `POST` request with the information about the skill:

```bash
curl -X POST 'https://toloka.dev/api/v1/skills' \
     -H 'Authorization: ApiKey PlaceYourRealApiKey_Here' \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     -d '{"name":"Programmer","public_name":{"EN":"Programmer"},"public_requester_description":{"EN":"You are an expert in programming languages"}}'
```

Refer to the [Create skill](https://toloka.ai/docs/api/api-reference/#post-/skills) section of the Toloka API documentation for more details about the request, its parameters, and possible responses. You will find examples of the requests for [Toloka-Kit](/docs/toloka-kit/) and other code samples there.
