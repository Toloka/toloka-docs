# Global skills

This is a special type of [skills](/docs/glossary#skill) in Toloka that show the general competencies of Tolokers, such as text processing or selecting objects in images.

## Benefits `{#benefits}`
- Use global skills if you want to quickly launch a [project](/docs/glossary#project) and recruit Tolokers who are good at certain types of [tasks](/docs/glossary#task).

- Our experiments show that global skills combined with traditional [quality control](/docs/glossary#quality-control) methods increase the correctness and consistency of labeling.

## Features `{#features}`
- Requesters don't create this type of skills. Global skills are created by the system.

- Projects created from certain templates are taken into account. For example, if the project is based on the **Video comparison (Side-by-side)** template, then the Tolokers will receive the **Video SbS** global skill.

- Global skills are assigned according to the percentage of correct answers.

- Global skills are updated daily by the Toloka team.

## Usage `{#usage}`
To use this feature, select **+ Add filter → Skills → Choose global skill** and specify the restriction for the selected skill in the added filter.

For example, the restriction `Global skills: Video SbS (monthly) > 80` means “Select Tolokers who complete the video comparison tasks better on average than 80% of other Tolokers”.
