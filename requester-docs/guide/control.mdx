# Quality control rules

Quality control rules allow you to get more accurate responses and restrict access to tasks to cheating Tolokers. All rules work independently.

## List of rules {#rules}

- To keep track of how often Tolokers make mistakes:

    - [Control tasks](/docs/guide/goldenset): Use them to assign a [skill](/docs/glossary#skill) to Tolokers based on their responses to [control tasks](/docs/glossary#control-task) and [ban](/docs/guide/ban?form-source=guide-control) Tolokers who submit incorrect responses.

    - [Majority vote](/docs/guide/mvote): Quality is based on matching the response from the majority of Tolokers who complete the same [task](/docs/glossary#task).

    - [Results of checking](/docs/guide/reviewing-assignments): Evaluate Tolokers based on the number of accepted and rejected responses.

- To protect your project from robots and cheaters:

    - [Fast responses](/docs/guide/quick-answers): Control the minimum time that must be spent per [task suite](/docs/glossary#task-suite).

    - [Skipped assignments](/docs/guide/skipped-assignments): Restrict access to your pool tasks for Tolokers who [skip multiple assignments](/docs/guide/pool_statistic-pool#skipped-tasks) in a row.

- To attract a variety of Tolokers:

    - [Earnings](/docs/guide/income): Limit the amount each Toloker can earn in the [pool](/docs/glossary#pool) per day.

    - [Submitted assignments](/docs/guide/submitted-answers): Limit how many assignments each Toloker can submit in the pool per day.

- To allow recompletion of certain assignments:

    - [Recompletion of assignments from banned users](/docs/guide/restore-task-overlap): Send [completed assignments](/docs/glossary#completed-tasks) to other Tolokers to redo them if the Toloker was banned.

    - [Processing of rejected and accepted assignments](/docs/guide/reassessment-after-accepting): Send rejected assignments to other Tolokers to redo them.

## Quality control presets {#rule-set}

Toloka has presets of quality control rules. Currently, there are three of them:

- **Elementary** — suitable for requesters who need tasks to be completed by a large number of Tolokers in a short time.

- **Basic** — suitable for those who need to balance quality and quantity.

- **Advanced** — a set with a large number of rules required for complex tasks.

The table shows the rules included in each of the sets.

|                | Earnings | Skipped assignments | Control tasks | Majority vote | Submitted answers | Fast responses |
|----------------|----------|---------------------|---------------|---------------|-------------------|----------------|
| **Elementary** | +        | +                   | −             | −             | −                 | -              |
| **Basic**      | +        | +                   | +             | +             | −                 | -              |
| **Advanced**   | +        | +                   | +             | +             | +                 | +              |

## How to set up quality control {#control_how}

You can configure quality control in the [pool](/docs/guide/qa-pool-settings) and in the [project](/docs/guide/project-qa).

  { title: 'Pool', value: <ControlList1/> },
  { title: 'Project', value: <ControlList2/> },
