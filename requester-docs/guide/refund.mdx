# Refund

You can return the funds previously transferred to your account in Toloka.

The steps for getting a refund depend on the way you added money to your account:

- [Refund money to your bank card](#refund-to-card)
- [Refund money to your bank account](#refund-to-account)

## Refund money to your bank card `{#refund-to-card}`

The steps for getting a refund are different for individuals and businesses.

### If the card you used for payment is valid `{#valid-card}`

  { title: 'Legal entity', value: <RefundList2/> },
]}/>

### If the card you used for payment is no longer valid `{#invalid-card}`

  If your card is not active or lost, you can refund money to your bank account:

<Tabs tabs={[
  { title: 'Individual', value: <RefundList3/> },
  { title: 'Legal entity', value: <RefundList4/> },
]}/>

## Refund money to your bank account `{#refund-to-account}`

You can return funds to your bank account in one of these cases:

- You transferred funds to your Toloka account using a bank transfer.

- The card you used to transfer funds to your Toloka account was lost, replaced with a new one, or canceled. For this, follow the steps in the [Refund money to your bank card](#invalid-card) section.
