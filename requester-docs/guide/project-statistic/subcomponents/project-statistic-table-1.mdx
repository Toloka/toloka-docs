The total number of completed [task suites](/docs/glossary#task-suite) (taking [overlap](/docs/glossary#overlap) into account).

There may be few completed tasks if your tasks are only available to a small number of Tolokers. This could be due to incorrectly configured [filters](/docs/guide/filters) or [skills](/docs/guide/nav). In this case, some Tolokers don't see your tasks.

It's also possible that training is too complicated or training settings are incorrect.

<Cut title="Recommendations">

It there are fewer completed tasks than expected, we recommend that you check the number of active Tolokers who can access your tasks. If there are none or very few, check Toloker filters, skill settings, and selection pools.

Also, try checking how this parameter might be related to the number of interested Tolokers, task completion time, and the number of banned Tolokers.
