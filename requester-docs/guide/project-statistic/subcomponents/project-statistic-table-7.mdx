This graph shows the percentage of correct responses in the control and training tasks.

<Cut title="Recommendations">

If the percentage is too low, maybe your tasks are too complicated or the instructions are not clear enough.

Maybe there are errors in the control tasks or they are irrelevant. If the tasks have links, make sure that they work.

Another possible reason is incorrect settings for the quality control rules. Maybe they fail to filter negligent Tolokers.
