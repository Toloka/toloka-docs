# Setting up quality control

<TolokaRequesterSourceQualityControl/>

<Note mode="warning" title="Warning">

Quality control rules that you set in the [project](/docs/glossary#project) are applied to all project [pools](/docs/glossary#pool), so you can't change them in one pool.

</Note>

To set up quality control:

1. Go to the pool editing page.

1. If you already have a pool with the appropriate quality control settings, you can copy it along with the audience settings. To do this, go to **Tolokers filter** and click **Copy settings from...** and then **Add Quality Control Rule**.

1. Under **Quality Control**, choose the rules you want to use.

    If you aren't sure which quality control rules you need, use a preset with default settings.

1. Make settings for the rules you added. For more information, see the [List of rules](#id_z4l_prs_2lb).

1. Click **Save**.

<Note mode="note" title="Note">

If you already have a pool with the quality control settings you need, you can copy it along with the audience settings:

1. In the **Audience** block, click the **Copy from another pool** button.

1. Select a project and pool.

1. Click the **Copy audience filters and quality control settings** button.

</Note>

## List of rules {#id_z4l_prs_2lb}

- **To keep track of how often Tolokers make mistakes:**

    - [Control tasks](/docs/guide/goldenset): Use them to assign a [skill](/docs/glossary#skill) to Tolokers based on their responses to control tasks and ban Tolokers who submit incorrect responses.

    - [Majority vote](/docs/guide/mvote): Quality is based on matching the response from the majority of Tolokers who complete the same task.

    - [Results of checking](/docs/guide/reviewing-assignments): Evaluate Tolokers based on the number of accepted and rejected responses.

- **To protect your project from robots and cheaters:**

    - [Fast responses](/docs/guide/quick-answers): Control the minimum time that must be spent per [task suite](/docs/glossary#task-suite).

    - [Skipped assignments](/docs/guide/skipped-assignments): Restrict access to your pool tasks for Tolokers who [skip multiple assignments](/docs/guide/pool_statistic-pool#skipped-tasks) in a row.

- **To attract a variety of Tolokers:**

    - [Earnings](/docs/guide/income): Limit the amount each Toloker can earn in the [pool](/docs/glossary#pool) per day.

    - [Submitted assignments](/docs/guide/submitted-answers): Limit how many assignments each Toloker can submit in the pool per day.

- **To allow recompletion of certain assignments:**

    - [Recompletion of assignments from banned users](/docs/guide/restore-task-overlap): Send [completed assignments](/docs/glossary#completed-tasks) to other Tolokers to redo them if the Toloker was banned.

    - [Processing of rejected and accepted assignments](/docs/guide/reassessment-after-accepting): Send rejected assignments to other Tolokers to redo them.
