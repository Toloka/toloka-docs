To download files on your computer, click the  button on the pool page.

You can download all files in the pool in one archive up to 4 GB in size. If the archive is too large (more than 4 GB), use the following tips:

- Select a single status or pick a smaller time range.

    For example, if you need to review assignments, only download the submitted assignments rather than the accepted or rejected ones.

    If the file still exceeds the permitted size, pick a smaller time range and download the archives in several batches. The time range can be reduced to 1 day.

- On the pool page, click **Review assignments** (or **View assignments** if they have already been accepted) to go to the page with the Tolokers' responses. Each string contains the Toloker's response to one task suite.

    Select the responses you need and click . Download the archives in several batches. You can select and download no more than 100 responses at a time.

- Use the [Toloka API](https://toloka.ai/docs/api/api-reference/#tag--attachment) to download files with responses.
