# Payment documents

Payment documents are handled in your [**Yandex.Balance**](https://balance.yandex.ru/index.xml?LANG=en) account.

You can access it from your Toloka account. To do this:

1. Enter a top-up amount in USD. The minimum amount is $1.

1. Click **Transfer**.

    You will be redirected to Yandex.Balance. Payment documents are located in the **Acts** section.
