To edit a skill using Toloka API, send a `PUT` request with all the skill parameters including the ones you want to modify:

```bash
curl -X PUT 'https://toloka.dev/api/v1/skills/11294' \
     -H 'Authorization: ApiKey PlaceYourRealApiKey_Here' \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     -d '{"name":"Programmer","public_name":{"EN":"Programmer"},"public_requester_description":{"EN":"You are an expert in programming languages"},"private_comment":"Got at least 5 right responses on control tasks with C++ or Python","hidden":true,"deprecated":false}'
```
