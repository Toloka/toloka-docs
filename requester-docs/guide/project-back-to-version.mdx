# Returning to a previous version of a project

All changes made to the [project](/docs/glossary#project) are saved in the version history. You can view previous versions or return to any of them.

The version number (for example, `1.2`) consists of two numbers:

1. The first number is the major version. It appears when you change a required field in the [input or output data](/docs/guide/incoming):

    - Add, remove or rename a required field.
    - Change the field from optional to required.
    - Change the field parameters that aren't compatible with the current specification:

        - Reduce the maximum or increase the minimum number of items in the array.
        - Change allowed string values.
        - Reduce the maximum or increase the minimum length of a string.
        - Reduce the maximum or increase the minimum value for a number.

1. The second number is the minor version. It appears when you make any other changes to the project.
