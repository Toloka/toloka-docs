# Returning to a previous version of a project

All changes made to the [project](/docs/glossary#project) are saved in the version history. You can view previous versions or return to any of them.

The version number (for example, **1.2**) consists of two numbers:

1. The major version (the first number) appears when you change a [required field](/docs/guide/incoming#required) in the input or output data:

    - Add, remove or rename a required field.
    - Change the field from optional to required.
    - Change the field parameters that aren't compatible with the current specification:

        - Reduce the maximum or increase the minimum number of items in the array.
        - Change allowed string values.
        - Reduce the maximum or increase the minimum length of a string.
        - Reduce the maximum or increase the minimum value for a number.

1. The minor version (the second number) appears when you make any other changes to the project.

<Note mode="restriction" title="Alert">

Changes to the major version of the project don't affect existing [pools](/docs/glossary#pool).

</Note>

To go back to the previous version of the project:

1. Go to the project editing.

1. Click **Select previous version** at the bottom of the page.
