# Registration

Toloka clients register and access Toloka using social authorization. If you registered in Toloka using an email address, please [migrate to the new social authorization](/docs/guide/migrate-new-auth) scheme.

To register in Toloka as a client and post tasks for Tolokers, you need to have one of the following supported social accounts:

- Google
- Facebook
- GitHub
- Microsoft

<Note mode="note" title="Note">

Depending on your current location the list of the available social accounts might differ and include or exclude some of the social services.

</Note>

Some of the clients can also authorize in Toloka using SSO authentication. Read the [Toloka SSO authentication](/docs/guide/sso/authentication) section which contains the detailed description of this method and its restrictions.

## Where should I register? `{#register}`

Toloka has two versions: production and sandbox. You need to register in each one separately to get access to them:

- **[Production version](https://platform.toloka.ai/auth?role=REQUESTER)**

    This is your usual workspace in Toloka. Here you [create projects](/docs/guide/project), [upload tasks](/docs/guide/task_upload) for Tolokers, and [get results](/docs/guide/result-of-eval).

- **[Sandbox](https://sandbox.toloka.yandex.com/for-requesters)**

    This is a place to test your projects and tasks. It can be useful to test complex projects before launching them. Learn more about [working in the sandbox](/docs/guide/sandbox).

The registration and sign-in processes are similar for both versions.

## Authorizing in Toloka `{#authorize}`

Toloka uses social authorization both for the **registration** and **signing in**.

To authorize in Toloka production version using one of the social accounts, go to the [sign-in page](https://platform.toloka.ai/auth?role=REQUESTER).

  { title: 'Registering', value: <AccessList1/> },
  { title: 'Signing in', value: <AccessList2/> },
]}/>

## Recommendations `{#concept_pkf_nks_vlb}`

- To avoid confusion, use the same social service to register as a requester both in the production version and sandbox.

- If you plan to share projects with coworkers or need help setting up your account, read our [Shared access to the account](/docs/guide/multiple-access) instructions.
