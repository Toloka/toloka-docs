# Results of manual review

If you don't want Tolokers who made a lot of mistakes to do your [tasks](/docs/glossary#task) in the future, set up this quality control rule.

## When to use `{#when-use}`

If [manual review](/docs/guide/offline-accept) is set in the [pool](/docs/glossary#pool), add a rule to:

- Set the Toloker's [skill](/docs/glossary#skill) based on their responses.

- Block access for Tolokers who give incorrect responses.

To have rejected tasks redistributed to other Tolokers, set up the [Recompletion of rejected assignments](/docs/guide/reassessment-after-accepting) rule.

## How to configure `{#rule}`

<Note mode="warning" title="Warning">

The **If** and **then** fields in this rule are required. If you don't fill in at least one field, you won't be able to save the rule.

</Note>

**Field** | **Overview**
----- | -----
**Recent tasks to use** | How many recent responses from the Toloker to use.<br/><br/>If this field is not filled in, the calculation includes only responses from the pool to which the rule is applied.<br/><br/>If the field is filled in, the corresponding number of responses is used. The rule takes into account responses from both the current pool and other pools where this field is filled in.<br/><br/>[Learn more](/docs/guide/remember-values) about how this field works.
**If** | <ReviewingAssignmentsTable1/>
**then** | <ReviewingAssignmentsTable2/>

## Examples `{#examples}`

You understand that the Toloker didn't complete your tasks well enough. You can block this Toloker's access to tasks that you're going to do yourself.

You can also assign a skill that you can use to either block access to tasks for Tolokers, or to encourage those who did tasks well.

### Blocking for incorrect responses

<Note mode="warning" title="Warning">

The assignments submitted by banned Tolokers will be taken into account if they are not rejected using manual review. They can be reassigned by setting up the [Recompletion of assignments from banned users](/docs/guide/restore-task-overlap) rule.

</Note>

]}/>

### Setting the skill

<Image width="700px" withBackground imageId="1677773312987" alt="" />

After 3 tasks are reviewed, the skill is set to the percentage of correct responses. Use the skill value to set access to other pools with [filters](/docs/guide/filters).
