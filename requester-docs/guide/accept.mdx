# Reviewing Tolokers' responses

You started a pool with [manual review](/docs/guide/offline-accept), and the Tolokers completed all your tasks. What next?

- Review the Tolokers' responses before the end of the **Review period in days** that you specified. At the end of the period, unchecked responses will be accepted automatically.

- If a Toloker didn't complete the task well, reject their response.

- The Toloker can challenge your decision by submitting an [appeal](#appeal).

<Note mode="note" title="Note">

Note that you can't change the task status if the task pool was [archived](/docs/guide/pool-archive).

## How do I review the tasks? `{#acception}`

<Tabs tabs={[
  { title: 'In the interface', value: <AcceptGuideList1/> },
  { title: 'Via Toloka API', value: <AcceptGuideList2/> },

## Appeal `{#appeal}`

Within 7 days after the review, the Toloker can challenge the result by [filing an appeal](https://join.toloka.ai/en/docs/web/priemka/#appeal).

You will receive a message from them that contains:

- Toloker ID (`assignment_id`) in the subject.

- Explanation of why responses should be accepted (optional).

To consider an appeal, you need the response ID. If the Toloker wrote to you from the rejected response page, the response ID is automatically attached to their message as a link. If there is no ID, request it from the Toloker.

Do the following:

- If the responses were mistakenly rejected, accept them.
- Consider all appeals and respond on time — within 9 days (from the moment when the task was rejected).

## Acceptance procedure `{#acceptance-procedure}`

1.1. The Customer shall accept the Services through the Customer’s Personal Account or API. Two types of acceptance are possible: automatic and non-automatic. The type of acceptance shall be defined by the Customer when placing the Task through the Customer’s Personal Account or API.

1.2. If the Customer chooses automatic acceptance when placing the Task, all Tasks performed during the term specified in the Tasks shall be deemed automatically accepted by the Customer from the moment when every particular Task is completed by the User, and the Services shall be deemed duly provided by Toloka and subject to payment regardless of any other conditions. If the Customer chooses automatic acceptance, no discrepancy between results of the Task and the requirements set by Toloka in the Instruction shall constitute a basis for refusing to accept the relevant Services.

1.3. If the Customer chooses non-automatic acceptance when placing the Task, the Customer shall designate a term, which extends from the moment of completing the Task by the User and may include from 1 to 21 calendar days, within which the Customer is entitled to check results of the Tasks and accept the Services via the Customer's Personal Account or API (hereinafter referred to as the “Term of Non-automatic Acceptance”). If the Customer fails to accept the Services within the Term of Non-automatic Acceptance, the Services shall be deemed to be accepted on the last day of the Term of Non-automatic Acceptance, duly provided and payable.

1.4. The Customer is only entitled to refuse to accept the Services, if all of the following conditions are present:

a) when placing the relevant Task, the Customer has chosen non-automatic acceptance;

b) the Term of Non-automatic Acceptance has not expired;

c) the Customer placed an instruction which contain the algorithm to be followed to get proper results of the Task and comprehensive requirements to such results (hereinafter referred to as the “Instruction”);

d) the result of the Task does not comply with the Instruction.

1.5. If the Customer, pursuant to cl. 1.4. hereof, refuses to accept the Services, including the cases of considering the objections under cl. 1.7. hereof, the Customer is entitled to use the amount contributed as prepayment for the relevant Services pursuant to the Agreement to pay for the Services when placing new Tasks within the term of the Agreement.

1.6. If the Customer, pursuant to cl. 1.4 hereof, refuses to accept the Services, the Customer shall specify, which provisions of the Instruction have been violated when performing the Task, using the Interfaces of Toloka Web-Site (including API).

1.7. If the Customer, pursuant to cl. 1.4 hereof, refuses to accept the Services, Toloka is entitled to forward objections to the Customer via the Interfaces of Toloka Web Site within seven (7) calendar days from the day when the Customer has refused to accept the respective Task. The Parties undertake to settle the dispute not later than within nine (9) calendar days from the day when the Customer has refused to accept the respective Task. Having considered the objections, the Customer may decide to accept the Services or reject them again. If, as a result of considering the objections, the Customer chooses to accept the Services, the Services shall be deemed accepted on the day when the Customer performs the respective action in the Customer’s Personal Account or via API.
