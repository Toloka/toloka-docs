# Starting and stopping a task pool

You can start a [pool](/docs/glossary#pool) if:

1. You uploaded tasks into it.

1. You have enough money in [your account](/docs/guide/budget) to pay for the pool tasks, including the [overlap](/docs/glossary#overlap).

To start the pool, click <img src="https://tlkfrontprod.azureedge.net/portal-production/static/uploaded/images/1675425184616/1675425184616_original_svg.svg" alt="" /> on the pool page or <img src="https://tlkfrontprod.azureedge.net/portal-production/static/uploaded/images/1675425177251/1675425177251_original_svg.svg" alt="" /> in the list of pools on the [project](/docs/glossary#project) page.

A started pool has the **Labeling** status. When all pool tasks are completed, the pool automatically switches to the **Labeled** status.

To stop assigning the pool tasks before all of them are completed, click <img src="https://tlkfrontprod.azureedge.net/portal-production/static/uploaded/images/1675425182790/1675425182790_original_svg.svg" alt="" /> on the pool page or <img src="https://tlkfrontprod.azureedge.net/portal-production/static/uploaded/images/1675425176800/1675425176800_original_svg.svg" alt="" /> in the list of pools on the project page.

New tasks can be uploaded to an open or closed pool.
