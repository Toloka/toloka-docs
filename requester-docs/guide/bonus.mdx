# Rewards

To motivate Tolokers to complete your project tasks quickly and provide high-quality responses, you can give extra rewards for individual tasks, or reward one or more trusted users (in addition to paying them for [task completion](/docs/glossary#completed-tasks)).

The reward amount can be from $0.005 to $100 per Toloker per time.

A [fee](/docs/guide/budget) also applies to rewards.

## For a task {#bonus-task}

This is the recommended method, since it is the most economical and targeted for motivating Tolokers.

To issue a reward for a specific pool task, use [online task review](/docs/guide/accept#acception):

1. Click the **Review assignments** button on the pool page.

1. Choose a task and open it. Please note that a reward can only be issued for an accepted task.

1. Click **Actions → Issue bonus**

    </Cut>

1. Fill in the fields in the **Issue bonus** window that appears:

    - **Bonus per user** in dollars.

    - **Topic** and **Message** for Tolokers. Specify what exactly the reward is credited for. To send messages in different languages, use the button for switching languages.

    <Cut title="Example">

    </Cut>

1. Click **Grant**.

## Selected Tolokers {#bonus-selected-annotators}

To issue rewards to Tolokers:

1. Go to the [Tolokers](https://platform.toloka.ai/requester/workers) page.

1. Choose the Tolokers who will receive the reward.

    </Cut>

1. Specify the [project](/docs/glossary#project) or [pool](/docs/glossary#pool) in the corresponding fields in the left part of the page.

    <Cut title="Example">

    <Image withBackground imageId="1675427149097" alt="" />

    </Cut>

1. To credit rewards to one Toloker, click the link to their ID in the **Toloker ID** field.

    On the page that opens, click **Actions → Issue bonus**.

    To credit rewards to a group of Tolokers click **Issue bonus**.

1. Fill in the fields in the **Issue bonus** window that appears:

    - **Bonus per Toloker** in dollars.

    - **Topic** and **Message** for Tolokers. Specify the projects and accomplishments the reward was granted for. To send messages in different languages, use the button for switching languages.

1. Click **Grant**.

    Before doing this, check the number of people who will receive the reward, and the total amount.

    <Cut title="Example">

    <Image width="490px" withBackground imageId="1675427130856" alt="" />

    </Cut>

The Toloker will see rewards for completed tasks, activity and quality of work in projects in their profile (the **History** tab). The transferred amounts are added to the list of payments.

<Cut title="Example">

<Image withBackground imageId="1675427151116" alt="" />

</Cut>

You can track money deducted for extra rewards in your [profile](https://platform.toloka.ai/requester/profile) on the **Spent** tab.

<Note mode="tip" title="How to work via Toloka API">

To issue rewards using Toloka API, send a `POST` request with the information about the rewards:

```bash
curl -X POST 'https://toloka.dev/api/v1/user-bonuses' \
     -H 'Authorization: OAuth AQC2AGAJgyNSA8CtpdO9MWy_QEB6s6kDjHUoElE' \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     -d '{"user_id":"fac97860c7929add8048ed2ef63b66fd", "amount":0.5, "public_title":{"EN":"Perfect job!"}, "public_message":{"EN":"You are the best!"}}'
```

Refer to the [Issue rewards](https://toloka.ai/docs/api/api-reference/#post-/user-bonuses) section of the Toloka API documentation for more details about the request, its parameters, and possible responses. You will find examples of the requests in [Toloka-Kit](/docs/toloka-kit/) and other code samples there.
