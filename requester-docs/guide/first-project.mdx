# Your first project

Learn your way around Toloka with the following steps:

1. [Create a project](#create-project).
1. [Configure a task pool](#configure-pool).
1. [Upload a file with tasks](#upload-tasks).
1. [Launch the pool and get the results](#get-results).

## Before you start `{#before-start}`

Make sure you're [registered](/docs/guide/access) as a requester.

Log in to the [sandbox](/docs/guide/sandbox) to create and test your project for free. This helps you avoid making mistakes and spending unnecessary money on a task that doesn't work.

## Step 1. Create a project `{#create-project}`

In the project, you'll customize an appearance of the tasks.

1. On the **Projects** tab, click **Create a project**.

1. Choose a project preset that matches your task. The preset has preconfigured settings, a template for the task interface, and sample instructions for Tolokers. You will need to make a few changes in the interface and instructions to fit your data.

    <Cut title="Presets for popular tasks">

    - **Image classification**

        Designed to determine which category an image belongs to.

    - **Product search relevance**

        Intended to rate how relevant products are to specific search queries.

    - **Object recognition & detection**

        Used to outline objects on images for training computer vision to detect them.

    - **Customer survey**

        Designed to collect information for research purposes.

    </Cut>

    If you can't find a preset that works for you, choose **Blank** to set up a project from scratch.

    <Image width="700px" withBackground imageId="d83848d7b16b3bc14b85e69fd84fb931" alt="Blank presets" />

    To learn how, see the [Initial project settings](/docs/guide/project) section.

1. Click **Choose this preset**.

1. In the **General information** section, fill in the project name and a brief explanation of what will happen within the project.

    <Image width="700px" withBackground imageId="1675425855087" alt="General information" />

1. In the **Task interface** section, do the following:

    1. Select **Template builder**.

    1. Edit the preset task interface to configure the task appearance.

    1. Click **Show specifications** to see the generated input and output data fields.

    To learn more, see the [Template Builder Help](/docs/template-builder/).

1. In the **Instructions for Tolokers** section, edit the ready-made instructions if needed.

1. Click **Save**.

## Step 2. Configure a task pool `{#configure-pool}`

A pool is a set of tasks sent out for completion at the same time. Create and configure the pool as follows:

<Image width="700px" withBackground imageId="db44f0f606c2f82cc5b97f1b8da341c9" alt="Create pool" />

<TolokaRequesterPoolWizard/>

## Step 3. Launch the pool and get the results `{#get-results}`

1. Start the pool by clicking **Start labeling**. This assigns the tasks to the Tolokers.

    <Image width="700px" withBackground imageId="1675425838511" alt="Start labeling" />

1. [Complete your tasks](/docs/guide/sandbox#self) as a Toloker by yourself.

1. Track your project with the real-time statistics on the pool and project pages.

1. When the tasks are completed, get the results:

    - Download a [TSV file](/docs/guide/result-of-eval) with the responses.

    - If you have used overlap, run [aggregation](/docs/guide/result-aggregation) to get the final results.

    - Get the [files](/docs/guide/result-of-eval) that Tolokers have attached to the tasks.

<Image width="700px" withBackground imageId="1675425852304" alt="Download the results" />

## What's next `{#what-next}`

- When you complete the testing in the sandbox, [move](/docs/guide/sandbox#export) your project to the Toloka production version and launch the pool for real Tolokers.

- View our [tutorials](/docs/tutorials/usecases). Perhaps there is an instruction that fits your task, and you will only need to insert your own data.

- If you don't like Template Builder, try out the [HTML/JS/CSS editor](/docs/guide/spec).

- See the [Toloka API](https://toloka.ai/docs/api/api-reference/) documentation to learn how to manage your projects via the API.

- If you have questions or problems, see the [Troubleshooting and support](/docs/guide/troubleshooting/troubleshooting) section.
