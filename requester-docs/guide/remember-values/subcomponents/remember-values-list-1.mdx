Toloka calculates all control task responses only in the pool to which the rule applies.

#### Example

The Toloker completes several tasks in pool A, where the rule calculates their skill. Then the Toloker goes to pool B with the same rule, where the field is also not filled in. In this case, the skill is calculated for pool B separately. The rule in pool B knows nothing about the Toloker's responses in pool A.
