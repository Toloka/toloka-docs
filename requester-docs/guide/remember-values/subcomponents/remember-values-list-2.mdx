Toloka calculates responses to control tasks not only in the pool to which the rule applies. Responses from other pools where the **Recent control and training task responses to use** field is filled in are also taken into account .

#### Examples

- The Toloker completes pool A, where the field value is set to N = 10. Toloka calculates their skill in the pool using the last 10 responses to control tasks.

- Then the Toloker goes to pool B, where the field in the same rule is not filled in. Toloka forgets the history of the Toloker's responses in pool A and starts calculating their skill only within pool B.

- Then the Toloker goes to pool C, where the field value is set to N = 20. Toloka forgets about pool B but remembers the Toloker's responses in pool A and continues to calculate their skill using the last 20 responses to control tasks.

What does this mean?

- When the Toloker gives 3 responses to control tasks, the skill is set to the percentage of correct responses. With each next completed task, the skill is recalculated.

- The history only stores the Toloker's last 10 responses to control tasks. As soon as they complete the 11th control task, the response to the first control task is forgotten.

The rule conditions set in the pool:

- Condition 1: **Recent control and training task responses to use** = 10.
- Condition 2: **Number of responses** >= 3.
- Condition 3: Assign a skill as soon as condition 2 triggers and recalculate this skill within condition 1.

| 1 | 1 | | Condition 1 (Toloka starts saving responses).
| 2 | 0 | | Condition 1 (Toloka continues saving responses).

| 10 | 0 | 50% — 5 out of 10 correct responses | Condition 1 (within the last 10 tasks), condition 2 (if at least three tasks are completed), condition 3 (assign a skill).
| 11 | 1 | 50% — 5 out of 10 correct responses | Condition 1 (within the last 10 tasks; then Toloka forgets the first response), condition 2 (if at least three tasks are completed), condition 3 (continue calculating the skill).
| 12 | 1 | 60% — 6 out of 10 correct responses | Condition 1 (within the last 10 tasks; Toloka doesn't remember the first two responses), condition 2 (if at least three tasks are completed), condition 3 (continue calculating the skill).

The rule works as in Example 1 with the exception that:

- The Toloker isn't assigned a skill. Toloka performs all calculations "remotely".

- After each completed control task, it checks whether the percentage of correct responses is more than 60 or not. If not, it bans the Toloker.

With this rule, it's difficult to understand why the Toloker was banned because you can't see how their skill changes. Therefore, we often use a combination of two rules (Example 3).

The rule works both as in Example 1 and Example 2.

<Cut title="Example 4 with skill setting, bans, and different parameters">

<Image width="700px" withBackground imageId="1675426840231" alt="" />

With these settings, it's difficult to understand why the Toloker is banned if they have a high skill level.

The rule conditions set in the pool:

- Condition 1: **Recent control and training task responses to use** = 5.
- Condition 2: **Number of responses** >= 4.
- Condition 3: When condition 2 is triggered, check the percentage of correct responses within condition 1 and recalculate it.
- Condition 4: Ban the Toloker if, under condition 3, the percentage of correct responses is below 60.
- Condition 5: **Recent control and training task responses to use** = 10.
- Condition 6: **Number of responses** >= 3.
- Condition 7: Assign a skill when condition 6 triggers and recalculate this skill within condition 5.

After completing the 12th task, the Toloker will have 60% of correct responses and will be blocked for poor quality.
