Both rules work independently:

1. If the Toloker gives at least 3 control task responses, the percentage of correct answers is assigned as the skill value. This is useful if you want to prevent Tolokers with a low skill level from completing your tasks.

1. If the Toloker gives at least 3 control task responses and the percentage of correct answers is less than 60%, they lose access to the project.

The calculation uses up to 10 of the Toloker's recent responses to the project's control tasks.
