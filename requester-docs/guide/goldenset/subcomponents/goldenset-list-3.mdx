All rules are applied independently:

1. If the Toloker gives at least 3 responses to the control and training tasks, the percentage of correct answers is assigned as the skill value.

1. If the Toloker gives 2 incorrect answers to 3 control tasks, they lose access to the pool for 10 days.

1. If the Toloker gives 2 incorrect responses to 4 control tasks, they lose access to the pool for 10 days.

1. If the Toloker gives 5 or more responses to the control tasks and the percentage of correct responses is less than 80%, they lose access to the pool for 10 days.

A set of rules like this prevents Tolokers from being banned for one incorrect response and lets you maintain high accuracy.
