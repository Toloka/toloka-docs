# History of skill changes

To download the history of skill changes:

1. Go to the [Tolokers](https://platform.toloka.ai/requester/workers) page.

1. Select the Tolokers whose skill changes you want to view.

   <SelectTolokers/>

1. Click on the Toloker's ID to view the detailed information.

1. Open the downloaded file and choose a pipe `|` as a separator. The file may contain the following fields:

    - `worker_id` — Toloker ID.
    - `pool_id` — ID of the pool where the skill is used as a [filter](/docs/glossary#filters) or in a [quality control rule](/docs/glossary#quality-control). If the value is empty, it means that the skill was assigned to the Toloker manually.

    - `skill_name` — Skill name.
    - `value` — Skill value.
    - `created_date` — Date the skill was created.
