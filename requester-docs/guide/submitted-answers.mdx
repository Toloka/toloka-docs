# Submitted responses

To involve as many Tolokers as possible, limit the number of tasks in the [pool](/docs/glossary#pool) per Toloker or [set a limit](/docs/guide/income) on daily earnings in your [project](/docs/glossary#project).

## When to use {#when-use}

Use this rule if you want to:

- Get responses from as many Tolokers as possible. For this purpose, set a low threshold, such as one [task suite](/docs/glossary#task-suite).

- Protect yourself from robots. For this purpose, the threshold should be higher, such as 10% of the pool's tasks.

<Note mode="tip" title="Tip">

Don't set large values in pools where Tolokers won't have time to complete the required number of tasks.

</Note>

## How to configure {#rule}

<Note mode="warning" title="Warning">

All fields in this rule are required. If you don't fill in at least one of them, you won't be able to save the rule.

## Rule example {#examples}

Task: you're conducting an opinion poll. To collect responses from as many Tolokers as possible, set up the **Submitted responses** rule.

<Image width="700px" withBackground imageId="8f72719bb27cdcd15b58a1e9a38cc60d" alt="" />

A Toloker who submits 1 assignment is restricted from accessing the project and can't complete your tasks.

<Note mode="restriction" title="Alert">

The assignments submitted by banned Tolokers will be taken into account if they are not rejected using manual review. They can be reassigned by setting up the [Recompletion of assignments from banned users](/docs/guide/restore-task-overlap) rule.

</Note>

## For developers {#for-developers}
