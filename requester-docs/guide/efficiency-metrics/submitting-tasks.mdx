# Submission rate

This indicator shows the percentage of submitted tasks and helps identify issues related to incorrect settings:

- The indicator does not show any value. Perhaps the set criteria for selecting Tolokers are too strict and your tasks are not available to them.

- A low percentage of submitted tasks indicates problems with the settings of individual fields.

- The percentage of submitting tasks is zero. In this case, check whether the field names specified in the task interface are correct.

## How to calculate

The indicator is calculated as the ratio between the number of submitted tasks and the number of started tasks.

<Cut title="Show the formula">

<Formula withoutContainer={true} content="$P_{subm} = \frac{T_{subm}+T_{accept}+T_{reject}}{T_{subm}+T_{accept}+T_{reject}+T_{expire}+T_{skip}}\times100$"/>

where:

- <Formula withoutContainer={true} content="$P_{subm}$"/> is the percentage of submitted tasks.

- <Formula withoutContainer={true} content="$T_{subm}$"/> is the number of submitted tasks.

- <Formula withoutContainer={true} content="$T_{accept}$"/> is the number of accepted tasks.

- <Formula withoutContainer={true} content="$T_{reject}$"/> is the number of rejected tasks.

- <Formula withoutContainer={true} content="$T_{expire}$"/> is the number of tasks that were not submitted within the allowed time.

- <Formula withoutContainer={true} content="$T_{skip}$"/> is the number of skipped tasks.

</Cut>

## How to estimate

- A good indicator is `> 90%`.

- A low indicator is `< 90%`.
