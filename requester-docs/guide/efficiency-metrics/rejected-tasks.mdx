# Rejected tasks

This indicator shows the percentage of rejected tasks. If the tasks are rejected too often, you should review the project settings.

## Features

- Only tasks with manual review are considered.

- The percentage is calculated for the last 2 days.

## How to calculate

<Formula withoutContainer={true} content="$P_{reject} = \frac{T_{reject}}{T_{subm}}\times100$"/>

where:

- <Formula withoutContainer={true} content="$P_{reject}$"/> is the percentage of rejected tasks.

- <Formula withoutContainer={true} content="$T_{reject}$"/> is the number of rejected tasks.

- <Formula withoutContainer={true} content="$T_{subm}$"/> is the number of submitted tasks.

## How to estimate

- A good indicator is `< 30%`.

- A low indicator is `> 30%`.
