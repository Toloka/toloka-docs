# Quality of interface

After completing a task, Tolokers rate different aspects of it. In particular, they indicate whether the interface is user-friendly. Based on these ratings, an interface quality indicator is generated.

<Note mode="note" title="Note">

If no Toloker has yet given a rating, the indicator value will be missing.

</Note>

## How to calculate

<Formula withoutContainer={true} content="$Q_{i} = {CSI}$"/>

where:

- <Formula withoutContainer={true} content="$Q_{i}$"/> is the interface quality indicator.

- <Formula withoutContainer={true} content="$CSI$"/> is the Tolokers' rating, which shows how satisfied they are with the interface.

## How to estimate

- A good indicator is `> 4.5`.

- A low indicator is `< 4.5` or missing.
