# Control task balance

This indicator lets you evaluate the balance of classes in [control tasks](/docs/glossary#control-task). To improve labeling quality, we recommend adding control tasks so that all possible responses are uniformly presented as correct. If you rarely use one of the possible responses in control tasks, you might see no errors in the Tolokers' responses.

<Note mode="note" title="Note">

If one of the possible responses occurs much less frequently than the others in control tasks, then indicator will issue a warning about this.
