You can run aggregation by skill if the pool meets the following requirements:

1. You set a skill that defines the level of confidence in the Toloker's responses. We recommend to use a skill calculated as the percentage of [correct responses in control tasks](/docs/guide/goldenset).

1. The [output data fields](/docs/guide/incoming) have allowed values.

<Cut title="Output data fields that can be aggregated:">

- Strings and numbers with allowed values.

    The allowed value must match the `value` parameter in the corresponding interface element.

- Boolean.

- Integers with minimum and maximum values. The maximum difference between them is 32.

If there are too many possible responses in the output field, the dynamic overlap mechanism won't be able to aggregate the data.

The allowed value must match the `value` parameter in the corresponding interface element.

</Cut>

1. The tasks were uploaded in the pool with [“smart mixing”](/docs/guide/distribute-tasks-by-pages#smart-mixing).
