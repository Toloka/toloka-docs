To aggregate responses to all completed tasks in the pool using Toloka API, send a `POST` request with the parameters of aggregation:

```bash
curl -X POST 'https://toloka.dev/api/v1/aggregated-solutions/aggregate-by-pool' \
     -H 'Authorization: OAuth PlaceYourRealOAuthToken_Here' \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     -d '{"pool_id":"1238218", "type":"WEIGHTED_DYNAMIC_OVERLAP", "answer_weight_skill_id":"91dbfd8f1bc3310fbbbd09f64b8ab6e5", "fields":[{"name":"result"}]}'
```

Refer to the [Aggregate responses in pool](https://toloka.ai/docs/api/api-reference/#post-/aggregated-solutions/aggregate-by-pool) section of the Toloka API documentation for more details about the request, its parameters, and possible responses. You will find examples of the requests for [Toloka-Kit](/docs/toloka-kit/) and other code samples there.
