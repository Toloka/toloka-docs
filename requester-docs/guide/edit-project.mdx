# Editing a project

You can view the list of created [projects](/docs/glossary#project) on the **Projects** page. Open the project page to view the [list of pools](/docs/guide/pool-main), [the project rating](/docs/guide/project_rating_stat) and [the project statistics](/docs/guide/project-statistic).

To edit project parameters, click <img src="https://tlk-infra-front.azureedge.net/portal-static/uploaded/images/1675425191477/1675425191477_original_svg.svg" alt="" /> in the list of projects or **Project actions â†’ Edit** on the project page.

<Note mode="restriction" title="Alert">

If you edit a [required field](/docs/guide/incoming#required), the changes apply only to new [pools](/docs/guide/pool-main). Existing [pools](/docs/glossary#pool) will continue using the previous version of the project.

#### Settings for displaying field tasks

Specify the settings for field task display if you use one of the field task templates.

The **Map provider for tasks** parameter allows you to specify which map the Tolokers will use. You can select one of the following options:

- Set by Toloker
- Google Maps
- Yandex.Maps

#### Common interface elements

You can specify which interface elements the Toloker will see when working on a task. To do this, click **Show common interface elements** and select the elements you need.

## Instructions for Tolokers {#project-task-instructions}

#### Instructions

Instructions are the basic rules that you need to tell Tolokers about before they start completing your tasks.

This field should contain formatted text with images, links, and tables if they're needed to make the task conditions clear.
