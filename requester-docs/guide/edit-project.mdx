# Editing a project

You can view the list of created [projects](/docs/glossary#project) on the **Projects** page. Open the project page to view the [list of pools](/docs/guide/pool-main), [the project rating](/docs/guide/project_rating_stat) and [the project statistics](/docs/guide/project-statistic).

To edit project parameters, click <img src="https://tlkfrontprod.azureedge.net/portal-production/static/uploaded/images/1675425191477/1675425191477_original_svg.svg" alt="" /> in the list of projects or **Project actions â†’ Edit** on the project page.

<Note mode="restriction" title="Alert">

If you edit a [required field](/docs/guide/incoming#required), the changes apply only to new [pools](/docs/guide/pool-main). Existing [pools](/docs/glossary#pool) will continue using the previous version of the project.

This field should contain formatted text with images, links, and tables if they're needed to make the task conditions clear.
