Action performed under the **If** condition:

- **extend overlap by** — Resend the [task suite](/docs/glossary#task-suite) for completion to other Tolokers.

    If you want an assignment to be automatically reassigned even if your pool is already completed and closed, turn on the option **Open pool if closed**.

- **reduce overlap by** — Decrease the number of times a task can be completed by Tolokers. For example, use this action to cancel the recompletion of accepted assignments.
