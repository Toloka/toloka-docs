# General criteria

## Dynamic overlap `{#dynamic-overlap}`

[Dynamic overlap](/docs/glossary#dynamic-overlap) (also known as incremental relabeling or IRL) saves your budget by not setting a fixed [overlap](/docs/glossary#overlap) for all tasks in the [pool](/docs/glossary#pool). An algorithm determines how many Tolokers should complete the same task in order to get a reliable result, based on the Toloker [skill](/docs/glossary#skill) levels and the consistency of their responses. It works well for tasks with response options and an overlap of 2–5 (like [classification](/docs/tutorials/image-classification) tasks). [Learn more about dynamic overlap](/docs/guide/dynamic-overlap)

## Toloker selection: training — exam — retry `{#selection}`
Each Toloker has their own strengths. Some people are good at finding typos, some like selecting objects in images, others do a great job transcribing audio, and some people are talented secret shoppers. But they all need to practice before completing a new task. Your [project](/docs/glossary#project) should have a [training pool](/docs/guide/train) and an exam (a [control task pool](/docs/guide/pool)) — this way, you can choose the best Tolokers. A "retry pool" will help Tolokers who make mistakes improve their skills and get a second chance to complete tasks.

## Bonus program and dynamic pricing `{#bonus}`
You can issue [bonuses](/docs/guide/bonus) to Tolokers for completing tasks well or [increase their payment depending on the skill level](/docs/guide/dynamic-pricing). This encourages Tolokers to try harder on tasks

If your projects meet these requirements, we'll be happy to partner with you and recommend your services to requesters.
