The anticipated time for finishing tasks, in days and hours. Calculated using the average time per task suite.

Formula:<Formula withoutContainer={true} content="$T_{left}={Assign_{left}}\times{T_{assign}}$"/>,

where:<br/><br/><Formula withoutContainer={true} content="$Assign_{left}$"/> is the number of task suite remaining uncompleted or those completed with insufficient [overlap](/docs/glossary#overlap).<br/>

<Formula withoutContainer={true} content="$T_{assign}$"/> is the average time per task suite. Calculated based on the amount of time since the pool opened and the number of task suites completed.

The time is updated as task suites are completed by Tolokers.

<Cut title="Recommendations">

- If the time is too long, it's likely you don't have enough Tolokers left in your project. Check the number of [active Tolokers](#active-users) and the average time per task suite.

- If the time has increased since the project started, you may have too many banned Tolokers.

- If the time started out long and it hasn't decreased, and the number of [active Tolokers](#active-users) is small, check the filter settings and training. Perhaps few people can see your tasks or Tolokers can't pass training.
