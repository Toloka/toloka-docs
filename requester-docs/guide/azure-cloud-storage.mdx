# Azure Blob Storage

<Note mode="note" title="Note">

You can use any photo hosting service to add a small number of images, such as [imgbb](https://imgbb.com/), [ImageShack](https://imageshack.com/), or [imgur](https://imgur.com/). This way you can quickly get direct links to your images to add them to the task file or instructions.

</Note>

To try [Microsoft Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/storage-blobs-introduction), create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/).

1. Enter the container name.

1. In the **Public access level** field, select **Container**.

    <Note mode="note" title="Note">

    Files will be accessible to anyone with a link. We recommend using hashed file names to keep your files secure. You can generate hashes using online tools (for example, [Online MD5 Hash Generator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function)). Learn more about [hashing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function).

    </Note>

1. Click **Create**.

<Note mode="note" title="Note">

You can set up the lifetime of files in the container so that they are automatically deleted after a specified number of days. [Learn more](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cdn/cdn-manage-expiration-of-blob-content).

</Note>

## Upload your files to the container {#upload}

1. To open the container, click on its name.

1. On the top panel, click <img src="https://tlk-infra-front.azureedge.net/portal-static/uploaded/images/1675425958460/1675425958460_original_png.png" alt="" /> **Send**.

1. <Cut title="Upload files">

    Select files on your device.

    </Cut>

    <Cut title="Upload files to the folder.">

    In the **Send to folder** field in the **Additional** section, enter the name of the folder. If the folder doesn't exist, it will be created.

    </Cut>

    <Note mode="warning" title="Warning">

    The name can't contain spaces. Files can't be accessed by link.

    </Note>

1. Click **Send**.

## Copy links {#get-files}

1. Select the uploaded file and copy its **URL** from the **Review** section.

1. All file links are created by the same template.

    Links look like this:

    ```plaintext
    https://<storage-account>.blob.core.windows.net/<container>/<filename>
    ```

    The link in the folder looks like this:

    ```plaintext
    https://<storage-account>.blob.core.windows.net/<container>/<file-path>/<filename>
    ```

    <Note mode="note" title="Note">

    To quickly get links to other files, copy the link to one of them and replace `<file-name>` with the names of other files.

    </Note>

1. In the [file with tasks](/docs/guide/pool_csv), paste the links in the column that matches the input data field to which this data is passed.

    For example, if you want to use images in the `image` field, specify the file links in the `INPUT:image` column:

    ```plaintext
    INPUT:image
    https://mytolokaaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer/newfolder/image1.png
    https://mytolokaaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer/newfolder/image2.png
    ```
