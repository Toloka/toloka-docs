The order and direction of sorting the results.

Available parameters:

* `id` — by id;
* `created` — by creation date. The date and time is specified in UTC in ISO 8601 format: (YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss[.sss]);
* `status` — by object status;
* `finished` — by labeling completion time.

You can specify multiple parameters separated by a comma.

To change the sorting direction (to sort in descending order), add a hyphen before the parameter. For example, sort=-id.
