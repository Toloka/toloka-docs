# Rate limiting

Toloka applies the following rate limiting to the requests from clients to the Toloka API.

## Requests per second

Toloka limits the number of requests that clients can send per second. If you exceed **300** requests to the Toloka API per second, the platform will return an error with the `429 Too Many Requests` HTTP status code. If the problem persists, please lower the number of requests per second and try and repeat your requests in a couple of seconds.

## API methods request limiting

Some of the API methods have their own additional limitations for the methods that allow you to create or edit objects during a minute, hour, or day. Once you reach the limit, the platform will return an error with the `429 Too Many Requests` HTTP status code and the reason for the error in the response body.
