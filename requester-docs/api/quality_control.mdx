# Overview

Quality control rules help regulate access to a project or pool: you can filter out Tolokers who give incorrect control task responses, skip too many tasks in a row, respond too fast, and so on.

A rule consists of two parts: the condition ("If"), and the action to perform when the condition is met ("then"). If there are multiple conditions, they are combined using AND.

To define quality control rules, add an array of `quality_control.configs` JSON objects to the [pool](https://toloka.ai/docs/api/api-reference/#tag--pool).
