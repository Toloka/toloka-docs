# Remove a proxy server registration

To delete a registered requester server, log in as a requester and send an AJAX request from your browser console.

## Request {#request}

```js
$.ajax({
    url: '/api/new/requester/proxy/proxy/{id}',
    method: 'DELETE'
});
```

## Response {#response}

If the request is successful, the server returns the `204 No Content` or `404 Not Found` HTTP operation status.
