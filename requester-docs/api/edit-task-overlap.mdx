# Edit a task

<Announce/>

Changes the task overlap.

You can:

- Set a [numeric value](/docs/api/create-task#overlap) or an [infinite overlap](/docs/api/create-task#infinite) to assign a task to all Tolokers (for example, for training tasks).

- Add preliminary responses or change [their values](/docs/api/create-task#baseline) if they were set.

    Preliminary responses are used to calculate  response confidence when dynamic overlap (incremental relabeling, IRL) is enabled.

- Make [control](/docs/glossary#control-task) and [training](/docs/glossary#training-task) tasks from regular ones or edit [responses](/docs/api/create-task#known) and [hints](/docs/api/create-task#message) for existing tasks.
