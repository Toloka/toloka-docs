**object**

Correct responses in a task (for control tasks). If multiple correct responses are possible, define `output_values` for each possible response and set the weight for the correct response (the `correctness_weight` key).

```json
    "<ID of field 1>": "<correct response>",
    "<ID of field 2>": "<correct response>",
    ...
    "<ID of field N>": "<correct response N>"
```
