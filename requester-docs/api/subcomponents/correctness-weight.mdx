The weight of a correct response in the range from 0 to 1.

Lets you count a response as partially correct. This is convenient when there is no single right response to the task.

This works like awarding points: if you need to complete one control task correctly to get a skill (receive 1 point), you may complete one task with a weight of 1 or two tasks with a weight of 0.5 or higher.

The default value is `1`.
