# API migration

The Toloka API is migrating to the `toloka.dev` domain. Access to the Toloka API is about to change. The current API domain (`toloka.yandex.com`) works in deprecated mode and will be disabled **since July 1, 2023**. You need to update your applications to use the new domain.

<Note mode="restriction" title="Alert">

If you do not change the domain, your requests to the Toloka API will end up with errors starting July 1, 2023.

</Note>

<Cut title="I'm currently using the Toloka API directly. How do I change the requests?">

You need to change the URL to which you send the requests. Replace the `toloka.yandex.com` domain part in the URL with `toloka.dev`. All the other request parameters remain unchanged.

For example, a cURL request to the Toloka API which gets the requester information should look like this:

```bash
curl -X GET 'https://toloka.dev/api/v1/requester' \
     -H 'Authorization: OAuth AQC2AGAJgyNSA8CtpdO9MWy_QEB6s6kDjHUoElE'
```
