# Recipes for Toloka-Kit common tasks

Before you can start using Toloka-Kit, you need to [register with Toloka](/docs/guide/access), [get an OAuth token](/docs/toloka-kit/registration), and [install the Toloka-Kit](/docs/toloka-kit/quick-start) Python library. After that, you can create projects, pools, upload tasks, and get results.

Use the list of recipes below to find out how to start working with Toloka-Kit.
