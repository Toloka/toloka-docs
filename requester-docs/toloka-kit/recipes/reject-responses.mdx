# Reject responses from Tolokers

_Reject Toloker responses with the IDs specified in the request._

## Steps to follow

<Import/>

<Instantiate/>

### 3. Reject Toloker response {#step-three}

[Find out](/docs/toloka-kit/recipes/get-responses) the ID of the Toloker response that your want to reject and use the [reject_assignment()](/docs/toloka-kit/reference/toloka.client.TolokaClient.reject_assignment) method to reject the response and leave a comment.

<CodeCopy
  isSmall
  theme="light"
  code={
    <HighlightChildren language="python">
      rejected_assignment = toloka_client.<Term term="reject_assignment"><RejectAssignment/></Term>('0001d38f5b--61c8be2074fdb82592f97887', 'The answer is not clear')
    </HighlightChildren>
  }
  textToCopy={`rejected_assignment = toloka_client.reject_assignment('0001d38f5b--61c8be2074fdb82592f97887', 'The answer is not clear')`}
/>

The Toloker response will be marked as rejected with the `The answer is not clear` comment added to it.

### 4. Print Toloker response status and public comment {#step-four}

The `reject_assignment()` request will return the [Assignment](/docs/toloka-kit/reference/toloka.client.assignment.Assignment) class object. You can use its attributes to print the information you need.

```python
print(rejected_assignment.status, rejected_assignment.public_comment)
```

You should get an output with the updated Toloker response status and public comment which looks like this.

```bash
Status.REJECTED The answer is not clear
```

## Complete code: Reject responses from Tolokers {#complete-code}

toloka_client = toloka.TolokaClient('PlaceYourRealOAuthToken_Here', 'PRODUCTION')

rejected_assignment = toloka_client.reject_assignment('0001d38f5b--61c8be2074fdb82592f97887', 'The answer is not clear')
print(rejected_assignment.status, rejected_assignment.public_comment)
