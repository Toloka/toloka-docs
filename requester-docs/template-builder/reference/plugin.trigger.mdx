# plugin.trigger

Use this to configure triggers that trigger a specific action when an event occurs.

The action is set in the `action` property, and the event is described in the other fields.

The event can be triggered immediately when the task is loaded (`"fireImmediately": true`) or when data changes in the property specified in `onChangeOf`.

You can also set conditions in the `conditions` property that must be met in order for the trigger to fire.

## Component properties {#properties}
