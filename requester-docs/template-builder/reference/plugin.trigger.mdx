# plugin.trigger

Use this to configure triggers that trigger a specific action when an event occurs.

The action is set in the `action` property, and the event is described in the other fields.

The event can be triggered immediately when the task is loaded (`"fireImmediately": true`) or when data changes in the property specified in `onChangeOf`.

You can also set conditions in the `conditions` property that must be met in order for the trigger to fire.

In the following example, the `plugin.trigger` component is used to modify the original search query: the word "cats" is added to the word "bobtail". This happens immediately after the task is loaded.

- [view.link](/docs/template-builder/reference/view.link): Displays a link.
- [helper.search-query](/docs/template-builder/reference/helper.search-query): Creates a string with a search query reference.
- [data.output](/docs/template-builder/operations/work-with-data): The output data. This is what you get when a Toloker clicks the **Submit** button.
- [action.set](/docs/template-builder/reference/action.set): Sets the value from `payload` in the data in the `data` property.
- [helper.join](/docs/template-builder/reference/helper.join): Joins multiple strings into one string, separating them with spaces or commas.
- [data.input](/docs/template-builder/operations/work-with-data): The input data. For example, links to images that will be shown to Tolokers.
