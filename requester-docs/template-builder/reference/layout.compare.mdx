# layout.compare

Use it to arrange interface elements for comparing them. For example, you can compare several photos.

Selection buttons can be placed under each of the compared items. You can also add common elements, such as a field for comments.

<Button themeColor="light" view="default" size="l" type="link" url="https://ya.cc/t/MwYMw5-q3x7Lrs">View example</Button>

Differences from [layout.side-by-side](/docs/template-builder/reference/layout.side-by-side):

- No buttons for hiding items. These are useful if you need to compare 5 photos at once and it's difficult to choose between two of them.
- You can add individual selection buttons for every item being compared.
