Determines whether adding and deleting areas is allowed:

- `false` (default) — Allowed.
- `true` — Not allowed.<br/><br/>You can use this feature when creating an interface to check whether the selection is correct, or if you need to allow selection only when a certain [condition](/docs/template-builder/reference/helper.if) is met.
