# layout.sidebar

An option for placing _(layout)_ items, which lets you arrange on a page:

- The main content block.
- An adjacent panel with controls.

The `minWidth` property sets the threshold for switching between widescreen and compact modes: when the width of the `layout.sidebar` component itself becomes less than the value set by the `minWidth` property, compact mode is enabled.

In widescreen mode, the control panel is located to the right of the main block.

In compact mode, controls stretch to the entire width and are located under each other.

To add an extra panel with controls, use the `extraControls` property.
