# Reviewing assignments automatically

Define clear conditions for your task to ensure that you get the desired output. The conditions check that a Toloker did the required actions.

In [Toloka](https://toloka.ai/), you can use conditions to automate the manual review process. For example, a Toloker can't submit an assignment before they meet your required conditions.

## Review features `{#features}`

- What can be reviewed:

    - Output data in [fields.*](/docs/template-builder/reference/fields);
    - Input data in [views.*](/docs/template-builder/reference/views) and [layouts.*](/docs/template-builder/reference/layouts).

- Where to specify conditions:

    - In the `validation` property of the parent component.
    - In the `condition` property of [plugin.trigger](/docs/template-builder/reference/plugin.trigger).

- A link to the reviewed data is specified in the `data` property.
- Some components don't have the `data` property, and you can only access them from the `validation` property of the parent component (for example, [condition.played](/docs/template-builder/reference/condition.played) and [condition.played-fully](/docs/template-builder/reference/condition.played-fully)).

## Making a field required `{#condition-required}`

To check that the data is filled in, add the [condition.required](/docs/template-builder/reference/condition.required) component.

In this example, a Toloker must fill in the text field, otherwise the “Submit” button won't work. The [condition.empty](/docs/template-builder/reference/condition.empty) component works the opposite way: it checks if the data is empty and returns `false` if the data has a value.

## Comparing values `{#condition-equals-or-not}`

#### Checking that values are equal

To check that the preset value and output value are equal, use the component [condition.equals](/docs/template-builder/reference/condition.equals).

In this example, if a Toloker responds “No”, a text entry field appears.

<Button themeColor="light" view="default" size="l" type="link" url="https://ya.cc/t/jlpDLfIe3ttEjY">View example</Button>

#### Checking that values are not equal

To return the values that don't meet the specified conditions, list them in the `condition` property of the [condition.not](/docs/template-builder/reference/condition.not) component.

In this example, if the `condition.equals` condition is met and returns `true`, `condition.not` returns `false` and hides the text entry field.

<Button themeColor="light" view="default" size="l" type="link" url="https://ya.cc/t/EQrcJAhh3ttEkP">View example</Button>

#### When there are multiple correct responses

To check that an array in `data` is a subarray for `parent`, add the component [condition.sub-array](/docs/template-builder/reference/condition.sub-array).

In this example, the component checks that the values `animal` and `human` are part of the `objects` array. If the responses “Human” and “Animal” are selected, the `helper.if` logical component displays the question: “Do the human and animal interact?”.

<Button themeColor="light" view="default" size="l" type="link" url="https://ya.cc/t/hKrpY1DO3xEBoC">View example</Button>

## Checking multiple conditions `{#multiple-conditions}`

#### Meeting all conditions

To check that multiple conditions are met, list them in the `condition` property of the [condition.all](/docs/template-builder/reference/condition.all) component.

In this example, a Toloker has to do two actions: to fill in the text field and to click the link in the interface. The “Submit” button won't work until both conditions are met.

<Button themeColor="light" view="default" size="l" type="link" url="https://ya.cc/t/UVTRP1wl3vw9ij">View example</Button>

#### Meeting at least one of the conditions

To check that at least one of the conditions is met, list the conditions in the `condition` property of the [condition.any](/docs/template-builder/reference/condition.any) component.

In this example, a Toloker has to perform at least one of the two actions: to select “Nothing is written there” or to fill in the “What is written on the image?” field. The “Submit” button won't work until one of the conditions is met.

<Button themeColor="light" view="default" size="l" type="link" url="https://ya.cc/t/UGnbki-73xPDHm">View example</Button>

## Checking conditions for specific components `{#component}`

Some conditions work only with certain [components](/docs/glossary#component). For example, [condition.link-opened](/docs/template-builder/reference/condition.link-opened) works only with `view.link`.

In this example, a Toloker has to click the link in the interface, otherwise the “Submit” button won't work.

<Button themeColor="light" view="default" size="l" type="link" url="https://ya.cc/t/DNok6Tun3ttEpZ">View example</Button>

## Can't find the desired component? `{#schema}`

In the [list of conditions](/docs/template-builder/reference/conditions), you can see all the available components with the name `conditions.*`. If you can't find the desired component in the list or want to use a preset [configuration](/docs/glossary#configuration), define a review in the [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/learn/getting-started-step-by-step.html) format using [condition.schema](/docs/template-builder/reference/condition.schema).
