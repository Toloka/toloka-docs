In this example, the `images` field with the **array** type will be created in the specification.

  ```json
  {
"images": [
  "https://cdn.stocksnap.io/img-thumbs/960w/surfer-wave_3DBOYBPB3X.jpg",
  "https://cdn.stocksnap.io/img-thumbs/960w/fisherman-silhouette_UADULRRHEK.jpg",
  "https://cdn.stocksnap.io/img-thumbs/960w/old-photo_GEQ27OWZVV.jpg"
]
  }
  ```
