To make sure that the Toloker played back the audio and at least started listening to it, use the `condition.played` component in the `validation` property.

```json
{
  "type": "view.audio",
  "url": "http://example.com/audio.mp3",
  "validation": {
    "type": "condition.played"
  }
}
```

<Button themeColor="light" view="default" size="l" type="link" url="https://ya.cc/t/wVqSKJCJ3ttC9M">View example</Button>
