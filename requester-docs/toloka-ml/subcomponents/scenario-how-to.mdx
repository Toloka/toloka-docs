## Running a scenario {#start-scenario}

To run a scenario:

1. Open [Models → Collections](https://tolokamodels.tech/models/podium).
2. Select a model from the list clicking its card.
3. The model description page opens. Choose either **Train** or **Infer** tab if the model supports this.
4. Fill in the scenario fields on your own.
5. Click **Run Scenario**.

<Note mode="info" title="Foundational models">

If you choose a foundational model, you will be able to create your own model based on it. Foundational models are marked with the <img src="https://tlk-infra-front.azureedge.net/portal-static/uploaded/images/1677056128215/1677056128215_original_svg.svg" alt="Foundational models" /> icon.

</Note>

If the scenario's run results in a model, you can view it in the [Models → Registry](https://tolokamodels.tech/models/registry) tab after the run is completed.
