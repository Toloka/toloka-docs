Access permissions are passed to datasets using the `Permissions` object:

```py
dataset.permissions = Permissions(
    # Groups with the read permissions
    read=['Toloka'],

    # Groups with the write permissions that can modify the dataset
    write=['matrixnet'],

    # Groups with access control permissions
    owner=['your_login']
)
client.datasets.update(dataset)
```
