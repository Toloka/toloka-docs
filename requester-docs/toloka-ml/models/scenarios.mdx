# Scenarios

## Overview `{#overview}`
A scenario is a set of standard actions. Training, generating, or fine-tuning a model can be a scenario. A scenario may result in both a new model and a set of some arbitrary data, such as predictions. A model generated by a scenario may have its own set of scenarios. In that case, the `Parent Model` field will contain a link to the current model's parent model.

Any launch is considered an experiment [run](/docs/toloka-ml/tracking/runs). Therefore, all features of regular runs apply to this launch.

## Scenarios for custom models or algorithms `{#custom-scenarios}`

To add a scenario:

1. [Add a model to the registry](/docs/toloka-ml/models/registry/#add-model).

2. Add your model type to a namespace:

    ```python
    from ml.pulsar.common.enums import EModelType

    from .custom_base import CustomBase
    from .untyped_model import UntypedModel

    MODELS = defaultdict(
        lambda: UntypedModel,
        {
            EModelType.CustomBase : CustomBase
        },
    )
    ```

3. Write a scenario. To do this, create a class based on the `IScenario` interface and define the `run` statistical method in it.
