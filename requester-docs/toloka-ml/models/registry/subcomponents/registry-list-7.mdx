Create the `Model` object and add the model to the Toloka ML platform database using the `add()` method:

```py
from pulsar.models import Model
from pulsar.common import LightScenario

client = PulsarClient(token='your_token')

model = Model(
    # (Required) The model name
    name='test',
    # (Optional) Tags added to the model used for searching
    tags=['tags'],
    # (Optional) The model alternative name, this can be set only once and can't be changed
    alias = 'some_model_alias',
    # (Optional) The model description
    description='This models was created in models_tutorial',
    # (Optional) The model artefacts
    artifacts=[
        ModelArtifact(
            # The artefact name
            name='model',
            # The artefact source
            source_type='source',
            # The path to the artefact
            data_path=f'//tmp/tmp',
        ),
    ],
    # (Optional) Permissions for access control lists
    permissions = Permissions(
        # read: List of the groups with the read access
        read=['readgroup'],
        # write: List of the groups with the write access
        write=['writegroup'],
        # owner: List of the groups with the dataset owner access who can edit the permissons, this is the dataset creator by default
        # owner=['your_login']
    )
)

model_uid = client.models.add(model)
```
