For the `pulsar.models` class, the following methods are implemented:

* `add()`: Adding a model to the registry.
* `update()`: Updating a model in the registry.
* `delete(id)`: Deleting a model from the registry, where `id` is the model UID.

Example of updating model parameters:

```python
from pulsar import PulsarClient
from pulsar.models import Model, ModelArtifact, ESourceType
# Gets the model using its UID
model = PulsarClient.models.get(id)

# Assigns a version to the model
model.version = 'version_x.y'
# Adds tags to the model
model.tags.append('some_tag')
model.tags.extend(['sa', '32'])

# Updates and saves data about the model to the storage
client.models.update(model)
```
