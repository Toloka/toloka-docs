# Collections

[Collections](https://tolokamodels.tech/models/podium) provides access to the latest popular models for solving problems. You can use models based on Collections through respective scenarios, including training them additionally.

## Foundation models {#foundation-models}

Toloka ML platform contains several so called foundation models. These models allow you to create your own models based on them.

Foundation models are available in the list of models in the **Collections** and are marked with the <img src="https://tlkfrontprod.azureedge.net/portal-production/static/uploaded/images/1677056128215/1677056128215_original_svg.svg" alt="Foundation models" /> icon.

## Model types {#model-types}

Apart from the foundation models, Toloka ML platform has two main model types.

1. Models that allow you to only interact with them (that is, to see them in action), but not train them or experiment with them.

1. Models that allow you to run [scenarios](/docs/toloka-ml/models/scenarios) — a set of parameters that is passed to the model to [start a run](/docs/toloka-ml/tracking/runs). For such models, Toloka ML platform has an easy toolset which allows reusing them. Some of models of this type also support interacting with them, but you might need to train the model before it allows interaction.
