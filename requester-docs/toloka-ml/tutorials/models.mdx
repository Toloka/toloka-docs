# Models

A model in Toloka ML platform is structured data about an ML model: search fields and artifact information.

Artifacts are model components that are necessary for its application. Artifacts are only registered in Toloka ML platform, they are stored at any other location that has a direct download link.

Model parameters:

* `name`: Model name. Required parameter.
* `uid`: Model ID. You can't set it manually.
* `alias`: Model alternative name. It is set once. It can be applied instead of the ID to safely use links.
* `submit_datetime`: Date when the model was added. You can't set it manually.
* `update_datetime`: Date when the model was last updated. You can't set it manually.
* `username`: User who added the model. You can't set it manually.
* `description`: model description.
* `tags`: tags.
* `status`: Model status. You can't set it manually.
* `permissions`: Access rights (`read` (read only), `write` (edit), and `owner` (change access rights)).
* `task_types`: Model task type. For example, text classification.
* `model_type`: Type for basic models.

Parameters depending on the version (you can set them regardless of other model versions):

* `artifacts`: Model artifacts.
* `light_scenarios`: Simple [scenarios](/docs/toloka-ml/models/scenarios). They are linked to a workflow or a run in Nirvana to create.
* `submit_datetime`: Date when the version was added. You can't set it manually.
* `major_version`: Number of major model versions. You can't set it manually.
* `version`: Number of minor model versions. You can't set it manually.
* `username`: User who added the version. It overrides the username of the user who created the model when viewing its details in the interface. You can't set it manually.
* `info`: Model version information. It is usually used to name its major version.
* `model_meta`: Model version metadata.
* `producer_meta`: Parent model metadata.
* `parent_uid`: Parent model ID.
* `run_id`: ID of the run that generated the model.

Model methods:

`add()`: Creating a model.
`update()`: Saving a model after updating any parameters. No new model version is created.
`new_version()`: Saving file changes and creating a new version. The version number is increased automatically.
`patch()`: Fixing specified version or model parameters. To change a version's parameters, use the `new_version` flag.
`get()`: Getting a model's ID or alias.
`find()`: Getting a model list.
`get_model_scenarios()`: Getting the `ModelScenarios` object to run scenarios.
`delete()`: Deleting a model and all model versions.

## Before you start `{#before-you-begin}`

Enable the modules and add your token:

```py
from pulsar.models import Model
from pulsar.common import LightScenario

client = PulsarClient(token='your_token')
```

## Adding a model `{#add}`
Create an object named `Model` and add the model to the Toloka ML platform database using the `add()` method:

```py
model = Model(
    # (Required) The model name
    name='test',
    # (Optional) Tags added to the model used for searching
    tags=['tags'],
    # (Optional) The model alternative name, this can be set only once and can't be changed
    alias = 'some_model_alias',
    # (Optional) The model description
    description='This models was created in models_tutorial',
    # (Optional) The model artefacts
    artifacts=[
        ModelArtifact(
            # The artefact name
            name='model',
            # The artefact source
            source_type='source',
            # The path to the artefact
            data_path=f'//tmp/tmp',
        ),
    ],
    # (Optional) Permissions for access control lists
    permissions = Permissions(
        # read: List of the groups with the read access
        read=['readgroup'],
        # write: List of the groups with the write access
        write=['writegroup'],
        # owner: List of the groups with the dataset owner access who can edit the permissons, this is the dataset creator by default
        # owner=['your_login']
    )
)

model_uid = client.models.add(model)
```

## Updating a model `{#update}`
Pass new model data in the `update()` method:

```py
model.description = 'New description'
client.models.update(model)
```

## Adding a new version `{#new-version}`

Next, use the `new_version()` method:

```py
run_id = 'c428f098-3c47-4e94-b12f-52be5a264d7b'
flow_id = '84d4a1d2-526f-4233-b003-c025731c5b32'
# (Optional) The model scenarios
model.light_scenarios=[
    LightScenario(workflow_id=flow_id, name='test_scenario'),
    LightScenario(workflow_run_id=run_id, name='test_scenario2'),
]
client.models.new_version(model)
```

Models have major versions that are used for displaying major changes. For example, updating the parent model.

To create a new major version , set the new_major_version flag to `True` in the `new_version()` method.

```py
model = client.models.get(model_uid)
model.info = 'UpgradedModel'
client.models.new_version(model, new_major_version=True)
```

As a result, the model's major version is increased by `1`, while its minor version is set to `0`.

## Editing parameters `{#patch}`
Replace specific parameters with no Model object created using the `patch()` method:

```py
artifact2 = ModelArtifact(
    name='mode2l',
    source_type='Yt',
    data_path='//tmp/newtmp2',
)
# Use the `new_version` attribute to change the version parameters
client.models.patch(model_uid, new_version=True, artifacts=Append([artifact2]))
```

## Getting a model `{#get}`
Use the `get()` method. To get a specific version, set it in the `version` or `major_version` parameter for the model's minor and major version, respectively.

```py
model = client.models.get(model_uid)
model_v_0_0 = client.models.get(uid=model_uid, version=0, major_version=0)
```

## Finding models `{#find}`
You can get a list of models using the `find()` method. You can use parameters such as `tags`, `user_name`, `date_from`, and `date_to`:

```py
models = client.find(tags=['test_tag_44'])
print(models[0])
```

## Getting scenarios `{#get-scenarios}`

Use the `get_model_scenarios()` method:

```py
scenarios = client.models.get_model_scenarios(model_id)

# Launches the scenario generation
scenarios.generate.run(
    dst_column: 'subtitle_generated',
    source_column: 'prefix',
    val_table: {
        'path': 'path'
    }
)

# Gets the test settings for the scenario generation
test_config = scenarios.generate.test_config
print(test_config)

# Launches the scenario generation with the test settings
scenarios.generate.run(**test_config)
```

## Deleting a model `{#delete}`
Use the `delete()` method:

```py
model = client.get(model_id)
client.delete(model_id)
```
