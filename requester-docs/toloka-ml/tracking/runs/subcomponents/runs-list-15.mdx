To view experiment details:

1. Open the [Experiments](https://tolokamodels.tech/experiments) tab.
2. Click the experiment row. This opens the page with experiment information. A link to that page looks like `https://tolokamodels.tech/experiments/{experiment_id}`. Using the same link, you can open a report on any experiment.

In the experiment details, you can filter runs in the same way as on the [Toloka ML platform homepage](/docs/toloka-ml/tracking/runs#filter-runs).
