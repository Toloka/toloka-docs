To view run details:

1. Open the Toloka ML platform [Runs](https://tolokamodels.tech/runs) page.
2. Click the run row in the table.

This opens a page with run information. A link to that page looks like `https://tolokamodels.tech/runs/{run_id}`. Using the same link, you can open a report on any run.

In the sampling results, you can see data of the types:

Metric, Image, Text, Audio, Video, Json, Link

To specify the column type, set the correspondence between columns and their respective types when uploading the run.

If no types are specified when adding the run, you can specify them in the UI in the format:

```py
{column_name}:type={type}
```

In addition to setting the column type, you can compare multiple columns of a dataset by using the following syntax when listing a column to be displayed:

```py
{column_name}:diff_to={other_column_name}
```
