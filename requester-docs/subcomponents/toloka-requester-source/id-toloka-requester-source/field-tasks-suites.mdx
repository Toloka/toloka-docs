For field tasks, you can only use the **Set manually** way to distribute uploaded tasks into suites. If you upload field tasks via the interface and not using the [API request](https://toloka.ai/docs/api/api-reference/#post-/task-suites), then the number of tasks will be the same for all task suites.
