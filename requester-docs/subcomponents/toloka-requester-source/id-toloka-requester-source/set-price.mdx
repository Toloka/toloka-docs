1. In **Price per task suite**, set the amount of money to pay for survey completion by one Toloker.

    In survey projects, a task suite must contain only one task. Otherwise, a Toloker will see several identical surveys on one page. You will set the number of tasks per suite later in this tutorial.

1. In the **Overlap** field, define how many respondents for each task you need.

    - If you are going to use one static link to your survey, the overlap should be equal to the number of respondents you need for the survey as a whole.
    You can also increase overlap when labeling is in progress or when itâ€™s completed.

    - If you are going to provide many survey links and each of them will be given to one Toloker only, the overlap should be set to 1.

    You will prepare the file with one or several survey links in the next step.
