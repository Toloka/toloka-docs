<Cut title="How do I create a task using both input and output text fields?">

You can see how it's implemented in the [Transcribing audio recordings](/docs/tutorials/transcript-audio) preset where a string-type output field is used. In the [Text recognition from an image (OCR)](https://platform.toloka.ai/requester/templates?choosedCard=Y3wa2gZzDJrTN9Q2KpnW) preset, you can view how to describe text input fields. Please note that if you later want to use the Dawid-Skene aggregation method, you must specify allowed values.
