<Cut title="What preset do I select so that Tolokers label only irrelevant products in the output?">

You can create such an assignment based on the [classification preset](https://platform.toloka.ai/requester/templates?choosedCard=W3Jpaqlz5QYfg3R1nb0a). Show a product image and ask the question: "Does the product match the query?" Add two radio buttons for task responses: “Yes” and “No”.
