<Cut title="I want to create another account using a social service. Is it possible?">

If you have accounts in different social services with different email addresses, then it is possible to use such services to create multiple accounts in Toloka.

You can't create several accounts in Toloka if the email address used in these social services is the same.

For example, you have a Google account with the <example@google.com> email address and registered in Toloka with it.

- You can register a new Toloka account with a GitHub account associated with the <example@github.com> email address.

- You can't register a new Toloka account with a GitHub account associated with the <example@google.com> email address, but you can add GitHub service with this email address to the existing Toloka account.
