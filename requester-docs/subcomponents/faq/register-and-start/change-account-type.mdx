<Cut title="How do I change my account type from “Requester” to “Toloker”?">

You can't change the account type from “Requester” to “Toloker”, but you can register two separate accounts using one social service.

If you want to complete tasks, you need to register in Toloka once again, with a different username, but as a Toloker.

To create a Toloker account, follow the [steps in the Toloker documentation](https://join.toloka.ai/en/docs/web/register/).
