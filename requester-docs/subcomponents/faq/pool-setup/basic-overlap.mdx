<Cut title="Can I do it like this: set a basic overlap of 2 Tolokers, then, if both Tolokers select the same response, close the pool, but if they give different responses, show the task to one more user?">

Yes, you can do that. Set up [dynamic overlap](/docs/guide/dynamic-overlap) (incremental relabeling, IRL).
