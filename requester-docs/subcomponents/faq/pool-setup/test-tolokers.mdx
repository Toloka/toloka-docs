<Cut title="How do I test Tolokers to determine which kinds of tasks they do better and assign them relevant tasks?">

You can add a [training pool](/docs/guide/train) to test your Tolokers. Based on the test results, assign skills to the Tolokers for the tasks they do best.

Then open your pools only to the Tolokers that have a certain skill: use [filters](/docs/guide/filters) for this.
