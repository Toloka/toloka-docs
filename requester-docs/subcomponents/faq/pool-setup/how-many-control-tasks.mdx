<Cut title="How many control tasks do I need to add?">

We recommend adding at least 1% of [control tasks](/docs/glossary#control-task) in the pool. And for small pools — 5–10%.

<Cut title="Why's that?">

Each control task is shown to the Toloker only once. If you use smart mixing, you determine how many control tasks should be in a suite. If each suite contains one control task, then the maximum number of suites the Toloker can complete is equal to the number of control tasks in the pool. If you increase the number of control tasks in a suite, the number of suites available to the Toloker decreases by the same number.

There shouldn't be too few pages available. Otherwise:

- You won't be able to correctly evaluate the quality of the Toloker's responses.

- The Toloker won't be interested in completing such tasks because they'll spend a lot of time studying instructions but won't earn much.

<Cut title="Example">

#### A large pool with 1% of control tasks (good)

There are 10,000 tasks in the pool, and 100 of them are control tasks (1%). Each suite contains 10 tasks, and 1 of them is a control task. Hence, a Toloker can complete up to 100 suites.

#### A small pool with 1% control tasks (bad)

There are 100 tasks in the pool, and 1 of them is a control task (1%). Each suite contains 10 tasks, and 1 of them is a control task. Hence, each Toloker can only complete 1 suite.

#### A small pool with 10% control tasks (good)

There are 100 tasks in the pool, and 10 of them are control tasks (10%). Each suite contains 10 tasks, and 1 of them is a control task. Hence, each Toloker can complete up to 100 suites

If there are few control tasks in the open pool, add new control tasks.

<Cut title="What for">

In a large pool with few control tasks, a situation might occur when Tolokers who have completed a lot of tasks in the project stop getting new task suites. This happens when the Toloker completes all control tasks in the pool.

<Note mode="note" title="Note">

To filter out Tolokers, use the [Control tasks](/docs/guide/control) quality control rule. To rank Tolokers by the quality of responses in control tasks, use a [skill](/docs/guide/nav).
