<Cut title="Why can't I find the Toloker's gender in the Toloker data, although I can filter people by this attribute in the pool settings?">

Requesters can't see the full details about specific Tolokers. So you can't see information like the date of birth, gender, last name, or first name. However, you can use filters by date of birth and gender (in the pool settings). This way you can select a group of Tolokers without accessing the personal information of individual Tolokers. This decreases the risk of Toloker de-anonymization.
