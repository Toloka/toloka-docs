<Cut title="How do I add new control tasks to an open pool?">

To make new task suites available to all Tolokers, including those who have already completed tasks in this pool:

1. [Stop](/docs/guide/pool-run-and-stop) the pool.

1. [Upload the file](/docs/guide/task_upload) with new control tasks.

1. [Start](/docs/guide/pool-run-and-stop) the pool.

For open pools, we don't recommend creating control tasks from other types of tasks that have already been completed. This is because Tolokers who have already given their responses to them won't be able to re-complete such tasks as control tasks. In order for these Tolokers to continue completing task suites, the control tasks in the pool must be new.
