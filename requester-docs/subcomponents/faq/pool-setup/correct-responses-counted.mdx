<Cut title="How are the correct control task responses counted?">

The [Control tasks](/docs/guide/goldenset) rule starts working after the Toloker completes the number of control tasks you specified. If your pool contains both [training](/docs/glossary#training-task) and control tasks, you can take into account the task responses in both of them (the **Number of responses** parameter) or only in control tasks (the **Number of control responses** parameter).

As soon as the needed number of task responses is collected, Toloka calculates the percentage of correct and incorrect task responses and performs an action (assigns a skill, or blocks the Toloker in the pool or in the project). Then this percentage is updated as the tasks are completed by the Toloker. The number of the Toloker's recent task responses that's used in the calculation is set in the **Recent control task responses to use** field. If you leave it empty, all the responses from the Toloker in the pool are counted.
