<Cut title="Which format should I use to review results if I'm looking to filter out mismatching Tolokers based on the “Majority vote”?">

To assign a skill to or ban Tolokers based on the majority vote, add a relevant [rule](/docs/guide/mvote) to the pool.

Don't forget to enable **Keep task order** in the pool parameters. Majority vote is used in the projects with preset options (radio buttons or checkboxes). This rule won't apply to the text entry or file upload fields.
