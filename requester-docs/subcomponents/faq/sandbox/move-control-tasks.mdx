<Cut title="How do I move control tasks from the sandbox to the main pool?">

The tasks themselves are not exported, only the project configuration and the settings of the selected pool. You can download the completed tasks from the pool in the sandbox and import them to the exported pool.

To download only the control tasks (if you completed them in the interface), go to **Mark up**, then click **Control tasks** and **Download**.
