<Cut title="Can I disable tasks for Tolokers who do a poor job on tasks?">

You can deny access to the pool if the Toloker's responses are [too fast](/docs/guide/quick-answers), if they don't match the [majority vote](/docs/guide/mvote), or if the Toloker makes too many mistakes in [control tasks](/docs/guide/goldenset). Tasks completed by such Tolokers can be [given to other Tolokers](/docs/guide/restore-task-overlap).
