<Cut title="Can I reject part of the task responses on the page and accept part of them?">

No. For example, there are 10 tasks in a suite that costs $0.10, and the Toloker did 2 of them incorrectly.

You can't accept the correct answers and pay for this part ($0.08). Task suite response pages are accepted or rejected in their entirety.
