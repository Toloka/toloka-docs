<Cut title="I use Toloka-Kit. Do I have to do anything to switch to new 'toloka.dev' domain?">

If you are a user of Toloka-Kit version 1.0.0 and later, you are good to go, no need to do anything.

If your Toloka-Kit version is older than 1.0.0, please update it. You can do this with the help of the following command:

<UpdateTolokaKit/>

<TolokaKitRelease/>
