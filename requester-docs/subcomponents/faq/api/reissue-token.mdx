<Cut title="Do I have to reissue my API token to get access to the API when I change the URL or update my app to the latest version?">

You don't need to reissue API tokens â€” they will continue to work. Once you use the new domain to connect to the API (or upgrade your Toloka-Kit or Toloka Java SDK version), you can continue where you left off. You'll still have access to all your projects, pools, and settings.
