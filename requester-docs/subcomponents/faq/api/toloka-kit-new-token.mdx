<Cut title="I use Toloka-Kit. Do I have to do anything to use a new API token?">

If you are a user of Toloka-Kit version 1.2.0 and later, you are good to go, no need to do anything.

If your Toloka-Kit version is older than 1.2.0, please update it. You can do this with the help of the following command:

<UpdateTolokaKit/>

Now you can update your token with the new one.

<TolokaKitRelease/>
