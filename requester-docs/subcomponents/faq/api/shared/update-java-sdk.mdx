If you are a user of Toloka Java SDK version 0.0.6 and later, you are good to go, no need to do anything.

If your Toloka Java SDK version is older than 0.0.6, please rebuild your Java application using the latest available Toloka Java SDK version.

Go to the [Toloka Java SDK page](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/ai.toloka/toloka-java-sdk) at the MVN repository and click the latest SDK version number.
