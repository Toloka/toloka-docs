<Cut title="How can I ban a Toloker and reject all their responses?">

You can't automatically reject the responses of a banned Toloker.

But you can do it yourself if you want. When downloading the results, select the option **Exclude assignments by banned Tolokers** to delete the responses of Tolokers who were banned at the moment of downloading. You can also forward all the assignments from banned Tolokers to other Tolokers using the [Re-completion of assignments from banned users](/docs/guide/restore-task-overlap) rule.
