<Cut title="Why can I filter Tolokers by gender in the pool settings, if gender isn't shown in the profile?">

The requester can't see the full details about specific Tolokers. For example, the requester can't see their date of birth, gender, last name, or first name. However, filters by date of birth and gender are available to the requester in the pool settings. You can use them to select a group of Tolokers without accessing the details about specific Tolokers. This decreases the risk of Toloker de-anonymization.
