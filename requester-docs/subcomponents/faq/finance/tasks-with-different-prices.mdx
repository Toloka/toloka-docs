<Cut title="Can there be tasks with different prices in the pool?">

No. The price per task suite is the same for all tasks in the pool. You can create multiple pools with different prices or [change the price](/docs/guide/dynamic-pricing) depending on the Toloker skill using **Dynamic pricing**. You can [pay bonuses](/docs/guide/bonus) to good Tolokers.
