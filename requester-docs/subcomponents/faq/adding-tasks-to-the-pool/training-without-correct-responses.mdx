<Cut title="Can I create training for projects where it is not possible to formulate the correct task response exactly or review it automatically?">

You can't create a training like this, because for the task response to be counted as correct it must exactly match the control text.

For projects using free text input or attached files, you can make a pre-selection task with manual review. You can admit good Tolokers to your main pool based on their skill.
