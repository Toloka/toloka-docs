<Cut title="If I change the time allocated for one task, will this apply to tasks assigned earlier?">

If you change the time allocated for a task, the time value will apply to the tasks that have not yet been taken by the Tolokers. The same applies to the case when you close the pool. A Toloker who has an assignment in the active status can complete the assignment.
