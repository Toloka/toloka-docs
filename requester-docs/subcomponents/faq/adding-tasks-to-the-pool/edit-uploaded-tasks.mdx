<Cut title="How do I edit or delete tasks uploaded to the pool?">

If you uploaded tasks to the pool using “smart mixing”, you can stop the pool and mark up your tasks: edit answers, hints, or delete tasks.

If you uploaded them using a different method, clone your pool and upload the new file with the corrected list of data to be labeled.

Refer to the [How to edit tasks by yourself](/docs/guide/task-markup-by-yourself) section for more information about how to edit or delete tasks.
