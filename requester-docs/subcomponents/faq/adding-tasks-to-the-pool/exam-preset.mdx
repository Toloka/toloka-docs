<Cut title="How do I create an exam with a preset number of correct responses?">

To do this, under **Test result**, go to **Recent tasks to use** and specify the number of recent responses from the Toloker.

Let's say you need to create an exam with three tasks, one task per suite. If the Toloker succeeds in two out of three tasks, they get the skill.

If your task uses manual review, to set up such a rule you need to specify 3 for "Total reviewed responses". As you can see in the screenshot, in the first case, all the Tolokers who completed 3 assignments and whose answers are reviewed will get the skill. In the second case, only those who have 2 or 3 assignments accepted will get the skill.
