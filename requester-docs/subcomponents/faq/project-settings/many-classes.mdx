<Cut title="I want to create a project with a big number of classes (for example, more than one hundred). Can I do that?">

You can, but we strongly recommend that you [decompose your project](/docs/guide/solution-architecture) into smaller ones. You can start with a project that contains not more than ten classes, one of which will be `Other`, and continue to label the data that falls into that category.
