<Cut title="Can I use my own JS to build an interface in Toloka?">

You don't have to use our components for task interfaces. Feel free to create a custom design for your tasks. To do this, delete the library from the project template:

- Click the gear button to open the settings.

- Delete `$TOLOKA_ASSETS/js/toloka-handlebars-templates.js`.

See the [How to use JavaScript extensions](/docs/guide/spec-advanced) section for descriptions of the structure of classes and how they work.
