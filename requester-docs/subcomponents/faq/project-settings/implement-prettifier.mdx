<Cut title="Are you going to implement an HTML/JS prettifier in the project design?">

We didn't intend this window for any sophisticated development. Usually, the content is prepared in a third-party prettified editor, and the resulting code is pasted to the window prior to the update.

However, in the context of [TolokaHandlebars](/docs/guide/t-components/handlebars) editability, there are no differences between our window and a third-party editor.
