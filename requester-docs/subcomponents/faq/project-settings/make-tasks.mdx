<Cut title="How do I make tasks that have a varying number of task response options and different options available?">

You can do this using [concatenation](/docs/guide/t-components/helpers#concat).

See the sample projects that can help you build an interface:

- [with checkboxes](https://codepen.io/Toloka_projects/pen/ErzmaM)

- [with a dropdown list](https://codepen.io/Toloka_projects/pen/eXgKLe)

- [with radio buttons](https://codepen.io/Toloka_projects/pen/vYGKZPz)

If you pass an array of values to the input field, use commas to separate the array elements. A task response option will be generated for each of them in the interface. Input/output data for the sample projects are provided in the comments at codepen.io.
