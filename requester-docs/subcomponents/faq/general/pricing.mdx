<Cut title="How much will it cost me to get my data labeled in Toloka?">

You set the prices for your tasks yourself. The pricing depends on the complexity of tasks, number of [items](/docs/glossary#item) to label, Toloker requirements, and much more. Depending on this, you can pay from several cents to dollars per labeling item.

Refer to the [pricing](/docs/guide/dynamic-pricing) section for more information about how to set up pricing and what the price suggested by Toloka is based on.
