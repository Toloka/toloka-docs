<Cut title="How long will it take to get the labeling results?">

The time to get the labeling results depends on your task complexity, availability of Tolokers that match your requirements (languages, skills, locations, and so on), and many other factors. Simple tasks can take several minutes while complex tasks require hours and days to complete. We recommend that you split complex tasks into smaller ones to get more matching Tolokers and receive the results faster. [More about task decomposition](/docs/guide/solution-architecture)
