<Cut title="I have a problem uploading data with more than 5,000 rows. Toloka website says that the file took too long. I am trying to use the API but it is not very clear where to find the 'pool_id' and how to correctly setup the suite">

An error when uploading a file with tasks may occur due to the size of the file. Please try and split the file into several parts and upload them to the pool separately.
