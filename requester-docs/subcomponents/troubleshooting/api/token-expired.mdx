<Cut title="My Toloka token expired. How or where can I find its lifetime?">

If you use old OAuth tokens, you can see the token expiration time on the **Integrations** tab of the [Profile](https://platform.toloka.ai/requester/profile).

The new API keys don't have expiration time. You can issue up to 50 new ones if you need to. Refer to the [Generating API keys](/docs/guide/api-token) section for more details.
