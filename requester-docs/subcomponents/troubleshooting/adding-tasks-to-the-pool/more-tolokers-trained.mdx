<Cut title="More Tolokers were trained than the training skill shows">

The pool shows the total number of Tolokers that completed at least one assignment. A training skill can be lost over time if you set [repeated training](/docs/guide/train) in the pool settings. This setting allows a Toloker to pass the training again after a certain period if the Toloker didn't complete any tasks in associated pools or if there was a large time gap between completing tasks (for example, because of a [ban](/docs/glossary#banning-tolokers)). The training skill displays the Tolokers who either recently completed training, or regularly complete your tasks so that the skill doesn't expire.
