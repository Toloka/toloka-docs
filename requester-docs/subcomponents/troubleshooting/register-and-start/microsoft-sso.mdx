If you registered in Toloka using a personal social account, you need to use it the next time you sign in to Toloka. If you choose an enterprise account, it might use [SSO authentication](/docs/guide/sso/authentication) which is different and will either create a new Toloka account or give you access to an enterprise client account (if your company has it).
