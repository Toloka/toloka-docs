<Cut title="I registered in Toloka using Facebook social account but now I don't see it in the list of available services and can't sign in">

You can register in Toloka via a VPN with a social account which is not normally available in your location. But, next time you try to sign in to Toloka without a VPN you will not see this social account at the sign-in page. That's why you will not be able to sign in.

To avoid this, either use VPN every time you sign it to Toloka or register using social services available in your location, for example, Google. Refer to the [Migrating to new social authorization](/docs/guide/migrate-new-auth#connect-account) section to learn how to do this.
