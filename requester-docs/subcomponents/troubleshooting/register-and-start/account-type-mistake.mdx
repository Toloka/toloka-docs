To create a Toloker account:

1. Log out of your requester account.

1. Go to the [Toloka](https://toloka.ai) home page.

1. Click **Join**.

1. Follow the system instructions.

You can use the same phone number to create a new account. For a step-by-step description of the registration process, see [Registration and login](https://toloka.ai/tolokers/docs/web/register.html?lang=en#register).
