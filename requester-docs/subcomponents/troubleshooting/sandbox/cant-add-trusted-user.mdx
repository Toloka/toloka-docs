<Cut title="I can't add a trusted user.">

Possible reasons:

- The Toloker isn't registered in the sandbox. The account you registered in the Toloka production version won't work. Make sure you have specified the correct _Toloker's_ account as a trusted one.

- The Toloker's account is [authorized via social networks](https://we.sandbox.toloka.ai/auth?role=TOLOKER). Use the Toloker's phone number or Toloker ID to add them to the sandbox. More information [here](/docs/guide/sandbox#self).
