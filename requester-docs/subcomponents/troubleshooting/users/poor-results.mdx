<Cut title="Tolokers completed the training successfully, but have poor results in the general task">

During the training, Tolokers follow the task instructions and practice completing your tasks. Based on the training results, the requester can select Tolokers who did well enough to get access to the main pool. However, the mere fact that the Toloker completes your training pool successfully does not guarantee that they will continue to demonstrate high-quality performance. Tolokers who did well on the training but had inadequate results in the general task might have obtained correct training responses from other people.

In addition to the training, be sure to set up [quality control rules](/docs/guide/control) in your main pools. This lets you control the quality throughout the task completion process. If the task requires that Tolokers send free-format responses or data files, use [manual review](/docs/guide/offline-accept) to pay for them only after reviewing the responses.
