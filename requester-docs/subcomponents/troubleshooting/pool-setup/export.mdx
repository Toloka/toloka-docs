<Cut title="When I export a project from the sandbox, the task files are not exported. Is this how it's supposed to work? I suddenly lost the markup of the control tasks that I created in the sandbox.">

The tasks themselves are not exported, only the project configuration and the settings of the selected pool. However, you can download your marked up tasks from the **Sandbox** pool and import them to the pool you created. To download the control tasks only (if you marked them up in the interface), go to **Mark up**, then click **Control tasks** and **Download**.
