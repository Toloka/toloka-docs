### I

##### Incomplete task suite {#incomplete-task-suite}

The last task suite which contains a number of [general](#general-task) tasks which is insufficient to form a complete suite. In this case, Tolokers will see a page with fewer general tasks and the full number of control and training tasks. Incomplete task suites can be enabled for tasks uploaded using [smart mixing](#smart-mixing).

##### Incremental relabeling {#incremental-relabeling}

See [Dynamic overlap](#dynamic-overlap).

##### Input and output data {#input-output-data}

The format of input and output data that you set in the **Data specification** field of the **Task interface** section when setting up a project.

  - _Input data_ is the source data you want to display or use. For example, links to images that will be shown to Tolokers. Use the `data.input` component of [Template Builder](/docs/template-builder/) to access the input data.
  - _Output data_ is the data you receive after the task is completed, like the Tolokers' responses to your questions. Use the `data.output` component of Template Builder to access the output data.

See the Template Builder [Read and write](/docs/template-builder/operations/input-output-data) instructions to learn about working with data.

##### Instructions {#instructions}

Project instructions that Tolokers see when choosing and completing the task. The clarity and completeness of the instructions affect response quality and the [project](#project) rating. Good instructions help Tolokers complete the task correctly.

##### Interested Tolokers {#interested-users}

The number of Tolokers who started at least one [task suite](#task-suite).

##### Internal data (used with Template Builder) {#internal-data}

The data available only from within the task. This data is not saved to the results. Use it to calculate or store intermediate values. To access the internal data, use the `data.internal` component of [Template Builder](/docs/template-builder/operations/input-output-data).

##### IRL (incremental labeling) {#irl}

See [Dynamic overlap](#dynamic-overlap).

##### Item (final answer, aggregated results, final label) {#item}

Corresponds to the final labeled data unit or a unique data unit to be labelled in Toloka. It is calculated as the aggregated result of all responses received for a task.
