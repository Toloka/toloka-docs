##### Sandbox {#sandbox}

The Toloka testing environment. This is where you can test your [project](#project) settings as a Toloker before moving them to the Toloka production version and running the project for real Tolokers. This helps you avoid making mistakes and spending money on a task that isn't working right.

##### SbS {#sbs-abbr}

See [Side-by-side](#sbs).

##### Selective majority vote check {#selective-majority-vote-check}

An option that allows you to selectively increase overlap for some [items](#item). This helps you save money and speed up [pool](#pool) completion. [Learn more](/docs/guide/selective-mvote)

##### Skill {#skill}

An assessment of the Toloker's quality of task completion on a scale of 0 to 100.

##### Skipped assignments (quality control rule name) {#skipping-tasks}

A [quality control](#quality-control) rule that restricts access to the [pool](#pool) tasks for Tolokers who skip several [task suites](#task-suite) in a row.

A pool statistics parameters which shows the number of Tolokers who completed and submitted at least one task suite in the pool.

##### Submitted responses (quality control rule name) {#completed-tasks}

A [quality control](#quality-control) rule that limits the number of [task suites](#task-suite) a Toloker can complete per day (taking [overlap](#overlap) into account). This allows getting a broader selection of users.
