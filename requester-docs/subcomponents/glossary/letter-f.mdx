### F

##### Fast responses (quality control rule name) {#fast-responses}

A [quality control](#quality-control) rule that restricts access to tasks for Tolokers who respond too quickly. You can use it to:

  - Suspend access for Tolokers who respond randomly. You can set a reasonable minimal time required to complete a [task suite](#task-suite).
  - Provide protection from robots (in this case, the time for completing the task suite should be much less).

##### Fee {#fee}

A percentage of the cost of tasks for which the requester is charged by the service when using Toloka.

##### Field task {#field-task}

A task that is performed at a physical location using the mobile app. It usually contains a point on the map that the Toloker needs to go to, check something, and take photos.

##### File with tasks {#tsv}

A file that contains the data you need to label. Requesters use such files to upload tasks. Toloka allows using [TSV](#tsv-format), [XLSX](#xlsx-format), or [JSON](#json-format) files.

##### Filters {#filters}

Criteria for choosing Tolokers. For example, you can select only Tolokers who speak English or have a certain skill.

You can use filters to choose Tolokers when setting up [pools](#pool) (in the **Audience** section), on the [Users](https://platform.toloka.ai/requester/workers) page, and for [sending messages](/docs/guide/messaging) to a group of users. [Learn more](/docs/guide/filters)
