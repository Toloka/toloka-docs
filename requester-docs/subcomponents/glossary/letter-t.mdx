### T

##### Task {#task}

A request or question that elicits a response from an annotator in [Toloka](http://toloka.ai/). A task is created for a single data unit that requires labeling, like a photo to classify, or a comment to review. It is a part of a web page (a [task suite](#task-suite)) that can contain various objects: images, text, input fields, and others. Tolokers read the instructions for the task, complete it and enter [responses](#response). In [Template Builder](/docs/template-builder/), you can create an interface for such tasks.

##### Task interface {#task-interface}

The appearance of a task for Tolokers and the logic for processing responses.

##### Task markup {#task-markup}

Adding correct responses and hints to the tasks and changing task types. You can transform a [general task](#general-task) into a [control task](#control-task) by adding the correct response, or into a [training task](#training-task) by adding the correct response and a hint. Task markup is available only for training pools and pools uploaded with “[smart mixing](#smart-mixing)”. [Learn more](/docs/guide/task_markup)

##### Task suite {#task-suite}

A group of several tasks given to a Toloker to submit all at once. For example, you can show four images on the same page. If the tasks are simple, you can add 10–20 tasks per suite. Don't make task suites too long because it slows down loading speed for Tolokers. A task suite may consist of a single task.

##### Toloka API {#toloka-api}

The application programming interface which describes methods (a set of classes, procedures, functions, structures, or constants) used by Toloka to interact with other computer programs, and allows you to create tasks and receive user responses. [Learn more](/docs/api/)

The requests to the Toloka API are made using the [HTTPS protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS). The service returns data in the [JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html) format.

##### Toloker {#toloker}

Any person from around the world who completes tasks in Toloka and gets paid for that. Collectively, they are usually referred to as "the crowd".

##### Training {#training}

A main [pool](#pool) that consists only of [training tasks](#training-task) and can have zero cost. Use it to train Tolokers before performing real tasks if you can't use a [training pool](#training-pool) for your project.

##### Training pool {#training-pool}

A [pool](#pool) of zero-price tasks for training Tolokers. Training tasks contain correct responses and hints that are shown if the Toloker answers incorrectly.

To improve the quality of results, you can add a training pool and choose only those Tolokers who pass training successfully. [Learn more](/docs/guide/train)

##### Training skill {#training-skill}

A [skill](#skill) that is automatically created when the first training pool is added to the project. The skill name is `<project name> - training`. The value is the percentage of correct responses in the training pool. The skill is assigned to the Toloker after they complete the training pool.

There is only one training skill for the entire project. If you create new training pools, they will use the same skill. [Learn more](/docs/guide/nav)

##### Training task {#training-task}

A task that contains the correct response and a hint. If the Toloker responds incorrectly, they will see a hint and won't be able to go to the next [task suite](#task-suite) until they complete all tasks correctly. Only the first response to the task is taken into account for [quality control](#quality-control) and [skill](#skill) calculation.

Training tasks can be used in zero-price [training pools](#training-pool) to choose Tolokers who pass training.

They can also be used in regular pools as [control tasks](#control-task) with hints. For example, you can track the percentage of correct responses and [ban Tolokers](#banning-tolokers) who respond poorly. To do this, use the [Control tasks](/docs/guide/goldenset) quality control rule.

##### TSV {#tsv-format}

Tab-separated values. A text file format in which data is separated by a tab, and lines are separated by a newline symbol.
