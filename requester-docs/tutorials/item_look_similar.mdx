# Project 3. Does the item found look similar to the original?

In this [project](/docs/glossary#project), Tolokers will compare shoes from the original image (shown in project 1) with shoes found in project 2.

<Note mode="warning" title="Warning">

Since the **Assignment review** option is enabled in the [pool](/docs/glossary#pool) settings for project 2, you should complete all the steps and check the Tolokers' responses within the time limit set in the **Review period** field.

</Note>

## Create a project `{#create_project}`

To create a project, open [Toloka for requesters](https://platform.toloka.ai/auth?role=REQUESTER).

In the interface:

1. Choose a preset:

   1. <TutorialsCreateProjectButton />

      <TutorialsChoosePresetImage />

   1. Click **Do it myself**.

   1. Select the **Image classification** preset.

1. <TutorialsAddNameDescription />

   1. In the **Name for Tolokers** field, enter `Are these shoes similar to each other?`.

   1. In the **Description for Tolokers** field, enter `Take a look at two pairs of shoes and decide whether they look similar or not.`.

   1. Optionally add a **Private comment**.

1. Edit the [task interface](/docs/glossary#task-interface) in the editor you selected:

   <Tabs
     tabs={[
       { title: "Template Builder", value: <ItemLookSimilarList1 /> },
       { title: "HTML/CSS/JS editor", value: <ItemLookSimilarList2 /> },
     ]}
   />

1. <TolokaRequesterSourceInstructions />

   Instructions text:

   ```plaintext
   Take a look at the pictures that show two pairs of shoes. Decide whether they look similar or not.

   Shoes are considered similar if they have a similar color, fabric, length, and style.
   If you don't see a pair of shoes in any of the pictures, click "Yes".
   ```

1. <SaveProject />

## Create a pool `{#create_pool}`

To create a pool:

1. Open the page of the project titled **Are these shoes similar to each other?**.

1. Click **Create new pool** on the project page.

1. <TolokaRequesterPoolType />

1. <TolokaRequesterPoolName />

1. <TolokaRequesterPoolDescription />

1. Click **Create**.

   1. In the **?** field specify `=`.

   1. Leave the **Absent** field empty.

1. (optional) In the **Speed/quality balance** section, specify the desired quality level. Improving quality may reduce the speed of task completion because the pool will be available to fewer Tolokers. Learn more in the [Speed/quality balance](/docs/guide/adjust) section.

1. <TolokaRequesterSourcePriceSettings />

   1. In **Price per task suite, $**, set the amount of money to pay per task suite done by one Toloker. For example, `0.01`.

Specify the **Control task** as a reason.

      <Image width="700px" withBackground imageId="1675426046741" alt="" />

## Download the reviewed results `{#get_results}`

To get the results:

1. Next to the **Download results** button, click <img src="https://tlkfrontprod.azureedge.net/portal-production/static/uploaded/images/1675425179291/1675425179291_original_svg.svg" alt="Drop-down button" />.

1. Choose the **Dawid-Skene aggregation model**. Learn more about [Result aggregation based on the Dawid-Skene model](/docs/guide/result-aggregation#dawid-skene).

1. In the window that opens, click **Yes**.

1. At the top of the page, click **View operations list**.

   <Note mode="note" title="Note">

   To track the progress, refresh the page from time to time. Aggregation takes from 5 to 20 minutes. You can start designing another project meanwhile.

   </Note>

1. When the operation is complete, download the file with the results. To do this, click **Download** in the **Files** column.

1. Use the file with the results from [project 2](/docs/tutorials/find_an_item_in_store#upload_file).

## Check the completed tasks `{#check_results}`

You can check the results in two ways:

- In the file with the results.
- In the pool interface.

#### Review assignments in the file with the results

To review the [submitted assignments](/docs/glossary#completed-tasks):

1. In the text or spreadsheet editor, open the file that you received after aggregating the results.

1. Prepare the file:

   1. Add a column named `ACCEPT:verdict` with the review results.

   1. Add a column named `ACCEPT:comment` with comments for Tolokers if responses were rejected. For example, comment on which part of the instructions wasn't followed.

   1. Rename the `INPUT:assignment_id` column to `ASSIGNMENT:assignment_id`.

1. Fill in the `ACCEPT:verdict:` and `ACCEPT:comment:` columns:

   - If the aggregate result of the assignment is OK, put `+` to accept it.

   - If the aggregate result of the assignment is incorrect or it doesn't open, put `-` to reject it. Specify the reason for assignment rejection in the `ACCEPT:comment:` field (for example, `The item provided is incorrect or doesn't open.`).

1. Delete all the other columns.

1. Save the file.

1. Open the pool page in project 2.

1. Click **Review assignments**.

1. Click **Upload results**.

1. In the window that opens, choose the file with the results to upload and click **Open**.

1. In the window that opens, compare the number of assignments in the **Processed successfully** field with that in the **Total submitted** field on the pool page.

1. Click the **Add** button.

1. In the window that opens, click **Close**.

1. When setting up the pool in project 2, you enabled the **Recompletion of the rejected tasks** option.

   In this case, the pool automatically reopens and the assignments are reassigned to other Tolokers. When they're completed, send the results for verification. Then download the results, check them, and upload the reviewed results. You can reject assignments as many times as you want to get more accurate results.

#### Review assignments in the pool interface

To check submitted assignments:

1. Open the pool page in project 2.

1. Click **View assignments**.

1. Hover over the line of the assignment you want to check.

1. In the **Status** column, you'll see the buttons for accepting (<img src="https://tlkfrontprod.azureedge.net/portal-production/static/uploaded/images/1675425175810/1675425175810_original_svg.svg" alt="" />) or rejecting (<img src="https://tlkfrontprod.azureedge.net/portal-production/static/uploaded/images/1675425174274/1675425174274_original_svg.svg" alt="" />) the completed assignment. If you reject the assignment, enter a comment in the window that opens and click **Done**.
