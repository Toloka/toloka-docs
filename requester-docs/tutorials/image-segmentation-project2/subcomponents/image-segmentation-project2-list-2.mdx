1. In **Task interface**, leave the **HTML** block unchanged.

1. Edit the **CSS** block:

    1. Set up the area selection tools. This template uses [Editor for image area selection](/docs/guide/t-components/image-annotation). It features rectangle and polygon tools (by default).

        To set up rectangle selection, replace the code in the **CSS** block with the following:

        ```css
        .image-annotation-editor__shape-polygon {
            display: none;
        }
        ```

    1. Enter the code to adjust the interface height to the image size:

        ```css
        .image-annotation-editor__annotation-layer {
            height: max-content;
        }
        ```

    1. **(optional)** You can ask Tolokers to enter an annotation for the selected area or select one from a list. To do this, add an interface element in the **JS** block. For example, a text field or drop-down list.

        Learn more about [annotation](/docs/guide/t-components/image-annotation#annotation).
