The template uses a special component to simplify development. Learn more in [Radio button](/docs/guide/t-components/radiobuttons).

#### Editing the output specification

Add a new field:

`radio_result` — A radio button (string type).

#### Editing HTML

1. The HTML code consists of blocks describing various interface elements. Each block may contain other blocks within it. There may be several nesting levels. For example, the block with a response button description contains other blocks with input fields. Each field contains other elements, such as a title and a comment field.

    Each block looks like this:

    ```html
    <div class="block_name">
    <!-- code for the block that may contain nested blocks -->
    ...
    </div>
    ```

1. Find the `main` block (it starts with `<div class="main">`). It contains several `main_block` blocks within it, each describing one of the buttons. For example, the “Photos of product and price tag” template has 4 response buttons, which means that its `main` block contains 4 `main_block` blocks for each of the buttons.

    Each button has a name for accessing its properties. For example, the buttons in the “Photos of product and price tag” template are named `btn_ok`, `btn_no_price`, `btn_no_item`, and `btn_no_shop`. Remember the name of the button that you are adding new fields to in the code.

    The `main_content` block inside `main__block` contains all the fields for the selected button. The description of each field is located in `main__content-block`.

    Find the button in the `main__block` block, then find the `main__content-block` field where you want to add a new field and paste the following code after it:

    ```html
    <!-- radio button -->
    <div class="main__content-block">
    <div class="main__content-title main__content-title_req">
    {{texts.btn_ok.question_new_radio.title}}
    </div>
    <div class="main__text">
    {{texts.btn_ok.question_new_radio.description}}
    </div>
    <div class="main__box">
    {{field type="radio" name="radio_result" label="Yes" value="Yes" size="L" validation-show="top-left"}}
    {{field type="radio" name="radio_result" label="No" value="No" size="L" validation-show="top-left"}}
    </div>
    </div>
    ```

    In this code, a radio button is added to the button with the name `btn_ok`. If you added a radio button to another button, change the name `btn_ok` to the right one.

    The radio buttons are listed in the `main__box` block as strings:

    ```html
    {{field type="radio" name="radio_result" label="Yes" value="Yes" size="L" validation-show="top-left"}}
    {{field type="radio" name="radio_result" label="No" value="No" size="L" validation-show="top-left"}}
    ```

    In the code above, a radio button with two elements is added: **Yes** and **No** with output values `Yes` and `No`. The output value will be passed to the `radio _result` field that you added to the output specification.

    To add new elements, paste the same strings the required number of times and rename the values of `value` (output value) and `label` (caption for a radio button element).

1. Update the acceptance mode.

    The `review` block contains the code for each button in the acceptance mode. This code is located in the following blocks:

    ```html
    {{#if (equal verdict "ok")}}
    <!-- code for the "ok" button in acceptance mode -->
    <div class="review__block">
    <!-- code for the "ok" button field in acceptance mode -->
    ...
    </div>
    ...
    {{/if}}
    ```

    The value of the response button selected by the Toloker is passed to the `verdict` variable specified in the output specification.

    For example, in the “Photos of product and price tag” template, 4 values are described for 4 buttons: `ok`, `no_price`, `no_item`, and `no_shop`.

    The `review__block` blocks contain a description of each of the fields for this button.

    Find the button by searching for the string `{{#if (equal verdict "response_button_value")}}`, then find the `review__block`, field where you want to add a new field and insert the following code after it:

    ```html
    <!-- radio button -->
    <div class="review__block">
    <div class="review__title">
    {{texts.btn_ok.question_new_radio.title}}
    </div>
    <div class="review__box">
    {{field type="radio" name="radio_result" label="Yes" value="Yes" size="L" validation-show="top-left"}}
    {{field type="radio" name="radio_result" label="No" value="No" size="L" validation-show="top-left"}}
    </div>
    </div>
    ```

    In this code, a radio button is added to the button with the name `btn_ok`. If you added a radio button to another button, change the name `btn_ok` to the right one.

    The radio buttons are listed in the`review__box` block as strings:

    ```html
    {{field type="radio" name="radio_result" label="Yes" value="Yes" size="L" validation-show="top-left"}}
    {{field type="radio" name="radio_result" label="No" value="No" size="L" validation-show="top-left"}}
    ```

    In the code above, a radio button with two elements is added: **Yes** and **No** with output values `Yes` and `No`. The output value will be passed to the `radio _result` field that you added to the output specification.

    To add new elements, paste the same strings the required number of times and rename the values of `value` (output value) and `label` (caption for a radio button element).

#### Editing JS

1. The JS code consists of blocks describing various interface elements. These blocks can be nested (buttons contain a set of fields, fields contain a set of elements, and so on). Each block is enclosed in curly brackets.

    The elements are described as follows:

    ```plaintext
    'property': 'value'
    ```

    The value can also consist of several properties, in which case it is enclosed in curly brackets and forms the next level of nesting.

1. The `texts` constant at the very beginning of the file stores all texts for each button.

    Each button has a name for accessing its properties. For example, the buttons in the “Photos of product and price tag” template are named `btn_ok`, `btn_no_price`, `btn_no_item`, and `btn_no_shop`. Remember the name of the button that you are adding new text to in the code.

    For example, in the “Photos of product and price tag” template, the texts for the `btn_ok` button are located in the following code block:

    ```javascript
    var texts = {
    //<common header text>
    'btn_ok': {
    'title': 'I found the price tag for the product',
    'question_1': {
    //<texts for the first field (photos of the store's front)>
    },
    'question_2': {
    //<texts for the second field (product photos)>
    },
    'question_3': {
    //<texts for the third field (photo of the price tag)>
    }
    },
    ```

1. To add the texts, put a comma after the curly bracket that closes the last field and paste the following code:

    ```javascript
    'question_new_radio': {
    'title': 'Radio buttons',
    'description': 'Select an answer'
    }
    ```

    Change the values of the `title` and `description` properties. The `title` property contains a title displayed above the group of radio buttons, and the `description` property contains a question for Tolokers.

1. Add validation.

    Find the `validate` function. It contains the code for checking whether the fields in each of the buttons are filled in. For example, in the “Photos of product and price tag” template, the code looks like this:

    ```javascript
    if (!solution.output_values.verdict || solution.output_values.verdict === '') {
    this.errors = this.addError('No answer selected', "verdict", this.errors);
    } else if (solution.output_values.verdict === 'ok') {
    // code for checking the ok button fields
    if (!solution.output_values.imgs_facade || solution.output_values.imgs_facade.length === 0) {
    // code for checking the imgs_facade field
    }

    if (!solution.output_values.imgs_item || solution.output_values.imgs_item.length === 0) {
    // code for checking the imgs_item field
    }

    if (!solution.output_values.imgs_price || solution.output_values.imgs_price.length === 0) {
    // code for checking the imgs_price field
    }

    } else if (solution.output_values.verdict === 'no_price') {
    //code for checking the no_price button fields
    }
    } else if (solution.output_values.verdict === 'no_item') {
    //code for checking the no_item button fields
    }
    } else if (solution.output_values.verdict === 'no_shop') {
    // code for checking the no_shop button fields
    }
    ```

    The response values for the buttons in this example, which are passed to the `verdict` output variable, have the same names as in the acceptance mode update step: `ok`, `no_price`, `no_item`, and `no_shop`.

    Find the validation block for the button. Inside this block, after any of the field validation blocks that look like this,

    ```javascript
    if (!solution... ) {
    // field validation code
    }
    ```

    add the following code:

    ```javascript
    if (!solution.output_values.radio_result) {
    this.errors = this.addError('This is a required field', 'radio_result', this.errors);
    }
    ```
