# Toloka LLM

Toloka LLM is a platform designed to simplify data-labeling with large-language models (LLMs) and provide you tools to get the high quality labeling results for your business case.

Currently, Toloka LLM allows you to complete text classification tasks using LLMs.

## Why choose Toloka LLM?

Toloka LLM offers the following advantages for you to easily start labeling texts with LLMs:

- Structured input: We bring structure to your interactions with LLM so your labeling task is solved in a predictable and robust way.

- Strong defaults: We provide you with a prompt and a model which are a great starting point for your experiments with the model or could be used right away.

- Flexibility: We aim to give you maximum control over the end result, so there are no hidden prompts. What you see is what is sent to the model.

- Quality evaluation: With labeled datasets enabling quality measurement you can experiment with LLM in an efficient non-guessing way.

- Easy deploy: You can use API to get labeled results or try and get results right from the platform interface.
