# Adding OpenAI API key

We provide you with a free $5 credit, so you can try the service and play with it. This will be enough to run tests, but to deploy variants you need to provide your OpenAI API key.

## Adding API key `{#openai-key}`

If you already have an OpenAI account, you can enter the OpenAI API key and continue labeling with your OpenAI account.

To do that,

1. Enter the OpenAI API key into the field.

    <Cut title="Where to get your OpenAI API key?">

    1. [Sign in](https://openai.com/) to the OpenAI website and visit the [API keys](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) page.

        If you already have an API key, you must have it saved somewhere as you won't be able to copy it from that page.

    1. To generate a new key, click **+ Create new secret key**. Set the key name and copy it to the clipboard.

    1. Now you can enter it into the Toloka LLM **OpenAI API key** field.

    Refer to [this page](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/authentication) for more information about authentication in OpenAI.

    </Cut>

1. Click **Add my key**.

You will be redirected to the Toloka LLM **Endpoint** page where you can [upload the dataset](/docs/toloka-llm/deploy#real-data) with real data and label it.

## Removing API key `{#remove-key}`

To remove the API key after you add it:

1. Hover the mouse over the profile name in the upper right corner.

1. Click **<img src="https://toloka.ai/files/key.svg" alt="OpenAI API key" /> OpenAI API key**.

1. Click <img src="https://toloka.ai/files/delete.svg" alt="Delete key" /> next to the key name.
