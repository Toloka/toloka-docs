# Registering and signing in

You must register or sign in to Toloka LLM before you can start use it.

Toloka LLM has two modes: demonstration mode and dataset labeling. You can choose one of them after [registering or signing in](#registering):

- **Demonstration mode**

    Allows you to get acquainted with Toloka LLM. It can be useful if you don't know anything about labeling with the help of LLM and want to see how it works.

- **Dataset labeling**

    This is your usual workspace in Toloka LLM. Here you create projects, specify classes, upload tasks, and get results.

Both modes look similar and the only difference is that the demonstration mode contains prepared sample datasets and predefined classes and labels. It loads automatically after you sign in to Toloka LLM for the first time. You can switch to dataset labeling any time from it.
