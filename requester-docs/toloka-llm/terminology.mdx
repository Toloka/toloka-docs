# Terminology

Toloka LLM uses the following terminology in its interface and documentation.

#### Dataset `{#dataset}`

A set of text to classify with optional labels.

#### Deployment `{#deployment}`

Making a variant available for use either through API or file-upload UI.

#### Project `{#project}`

A set of parameters, prompts, and datasets which result in different variants you can deploy and use for labeling. This is also a separate business goal you want to achieve with Toloka LLM.

#### Prompt `{#prompt}`

An instruction that LLM uses to provide a correct answer for your dataset.

#### Variant `{#variant}`

A combination of a model, its settings and a prompt. Our tool facilitates the process of finding the best variant for your task in a measured way. Once you have a variant that satisfies you, it can be deployed.
