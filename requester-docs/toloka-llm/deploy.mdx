# Deploying project

You can deploy the project right after you create it and generate variants.

<Note mode="note" title="Note">

We provide you with a free $5 credit, so you can try the service and play with it. Once you use it, you either need to provide us with an [OpenAI API key](/docs/toloka-llm/funds#openai-key) or [top up your balance](/docs/toloka-llm/funds#bank-card).

</Note>

When you have a variant with the accuracy to price ratio that fits your purpose, deploy the project and use it with real datasets.

For that, click **<img src="https://toloka.ai/files/deploy.svg" alt="Deploy" /> Deploy** on the [variant card](/docs/toloka-llm/variants).

- If you have enough funds on your account, you will be redirected to the variant page where you can test the model on [real data](#real-data) and [download the results](/docs/toloka-llm/results).

- If haven't added OpenAI API key or don't have a bank card attached to your account, you will [have to do this](/docs/toloka-llm/funds).

The currently deployed variant will be available at the **Deployment** page.

## Uploading real data to label `{#real-data}`

Now you can upload real data and label it.

1. Click **<img src="https://toloka.ai/files/upload-dataset.svg" alt="Upload dataset" /> Upload dataset**.

1. Choose the dataset with the data you want to label.

1. When the dataset is uploaded, click **<img src="https://toloka.ai/files/start-labeling.svg" alt="Start labeling" /> Start labeling**

The labeling will take some time. When it's finished, you can [view the labeling statistics](/docs/toloka-llm/results#statistics) and [download the results](/docs/toloka-llm/results#get-results).
