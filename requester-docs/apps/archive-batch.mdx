# Archiving batches

You can [archive](#archive-batch) the batch with the data to hide it. The data will not be deleted or lost in this case. To restore it later, [unarchive](#unarchive-batch) the previously archived batch.

## Archiving batches `{#archive-batch}`

<Note mode="note" title="Note">

You can archive only batches which are currently in statuses other than **Processing**.

</Note>

<Tabs tabs={[
  { title: 'From a project', value: <ArchiveBatchList1/> },
  { title: 'From a batch', value: <ArchiveBatchList2/> },
  { title: 'Using the apps API', value: <ArchiveBatchList3/> },
]}/>

After this, both the uploaded items and the batch itself get the **Archived** status.

The only action available for the archived batches in the interface is to [download the results](/docs/apps/download-results).

## Unarchiving batches `{#unarchive-batch}`

You can't restore archived data using the platform interface. Use the apps API instead.

Send the following `POST` request:

```bash
curl -X POST 'https://toloka.dev/api/app/v0/app-projects/{project_id}/batches/{batch_id}/unarchive' \
     -H 'Authorization: OAuth PlaceYourRealOAuthToken_Here'
```

Where `{project_id}` is the ID of the project with which the batch is associated, and `{batch_id}` is the ID of the batch you want to unarchive.

<Note mode="tip" title="Visit apps API reference">

Refer to the [Unarchive batch](https://toloka.ai/docs/api/apps-reference/#post-/app-projects/-app_project_id-/batches/-batch_id-/unarchive) section of the apps API documentation for more details about the request, its parameters, and possible responses. You will find examples of the requests for [Toloka-Kit](/docs/toloka-kit/) and other code samples there.

</Note>

After the operation, the batch gets the status it had before archiving. You can continue interacting with it.
