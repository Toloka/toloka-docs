1. Fill out the [form](https://toloka.ai/talk-to-us/) providing information about your planned project.

1. The Toloka team will contact you and discuss the details of your project and the contract associated with it.

Once all the details are agreed upon, you'll see your project on the **Bespoke** tab. You can then [start uploading](#new-batch) <Term term="task items"><TaskItem/></Term> into it.

## Upload task items `{#new-batch}`

<Note mode="note" title="Note">

Before uploading task items to a batch, you need to upload them to photo hosting or cloud storage. Learn more in the [Where to store data](/docs/guide/cloud-storage) section.

</Note>

Your items are uploaded to a batch. A batch is a set of data for labeling that you'll assign to performers at a time. You'll get labeling results separately for each batch, too.

1. Select your project on the **Bespoke** tab.

1. Click **Create batch**.

1. Enter a name for the batch.

1. Upload task items in one of the following ways:

    - Upload a ready-made TSV file.

    - Enter the data in text format.

      Each line with data is a task item. You can later view each item's status.

1. Click **Create batch** again. Done! You created a batch.

1. Send the batch for labeling by clicking **Launch**.

## What's next `{#whats-next}`

- [Download the labeling results](/docs/apps/download-results)

- [Upload more items to the batch or create a new one](/docs/apps/add-task)

- [Rename the batch](/docs/apps/add-task#rename)
