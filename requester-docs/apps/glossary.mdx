# Terms and definitions

## Batch for labeling

A batch of data that you send for labeling at a time. The batch consists of task items.

## Bespoke project

A bespoke project is based on a ready-made solution with the parameters that you specified. The interface and quality controls are pre-configured, decomposition is already done, and everything is ready to use: all you need is to upload task items to batches and send them for labeling.

## Bespoke solution

A bespoke solution is an example of a standard task that you can solve using Toloka. Unlike [self-service project](/docs/guide/overview#project) templates, you don't have to set up everything yourself.

## Task item

A task item is a labeling unit &mdash; in other words, data uploaded to a batch. The batch consists of task items, and the project consists of batches.

## TSV file

TSV (tab-separated values) is a text file format, in which data is separated by a tab, and lines are separated by a newline symbol.
