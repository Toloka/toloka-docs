1. Set the type of internet connection depending on the task type:

    #### Field tasks

    You can complete field tasks without permanent internet connection. You only need the internet to choose and reserve tasks and send responses.

    - Wi-Fi only — Turn on **Submit over Wi-Fi only**.

    This option saves cellular data. Your responses are stored on your device and are submitted as soon as Wi-Fi is available.

    <Note mode="note" title="Note">

    You need to make sure your responses are submitted before the task time expires.

    </Note>

    - Wi-Fi or mobile network — Turn off **Submit over Wi-Fi only**.

    This option means you can send responses immediately after you complete tasks, as soon as you are connected to the internet.

    #### Non-field tasks

    Non-field tasks require a constant internet connection.

    - Wi-Fi only — Turn on **Submit over Wi-Fi only**.

    - Wi-Fi or mobile network — Turn off **Submit over Wi-Fi only**.
