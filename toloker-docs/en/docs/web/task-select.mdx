# Task list

Open the [Tasks](https://toloka.yandex.ru/tasks) page. By default, tasks are displayed according to the **favorites first** criteria. You can set a different sorting order in the row above:

- **newest first**
- **price**
- **favorites first**

You can also filter tasks by category (with training, with post acceptance, hidden, and so on) and by requester.

Unavailable tasks are marked with the <img src="https://yastatic.net/s3/doc-binary/freeze/ru/toloka-common/ffff7f0618be7fe3d467ae1da45110b236860ecd.svg" alt="" /> icon. The condition for accessing the task is indicated next to it. For example, the "mobile app" condition means that the task can't be completed in the desktop version of Toloka, only in the mobile app.

## Favorites and hidden tasks `{#selected-n-hidden}`

You can add a task to your favorites or hide it in the list.

**Add task to favorites**

- Hover over the task card and click <img src="https://tlkfrontprod.azureedge.net/portal-production/static/uploaded/images/1676733319521/1676733319521_original_svg.svg" alt="" /> on the right.

Click **favorites first** to display the selected tasks at the top of the list. If the tasks in the favorites list are inactive, you might have run out of them, or made a lot of mistakes, and the customer restricted your access to them. When the new tasks appear, they will be active again.
