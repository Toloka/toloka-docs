<Cut title="When will I get a bonus?">

When the session is closed, the bonus is calculated based on the number of completed tasks. Within 24 hours, UHRS transfers money to Toloka account. These funds are initially unavailable for withdrawals as the tasks undergo review. It might take up to 7 days. Withdrawal of funds will be available after the review period.

In the upper right corner of the screen, you can see two amounts of money of different colors:

- Gray sum shows the bonuses for tasks that are under review;

- Green sum indicates funds available for withdrawal from Toloka.
