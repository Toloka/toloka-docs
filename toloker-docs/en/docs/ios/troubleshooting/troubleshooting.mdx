# Troubleshooting

Choose the problem you have:

<Cut title="Problem with registration or login">

<TroubleshootingContent1/>

<Cut title="I don't remember my username or password">

If you don't remember your password, restore it in the social network with which you registered on the platform. Toloka doesn't store any passwords.

<Cut title="Questions about projects">

<TroubleshootingContent13/>

<Cut title="How do I remove a reservation from a task?">

After the expiration of the allotted period, the reservation is automatically removed and the projects return to the main page. You can remove the reservation manually. To do this, go to the task set, click **←** and select **Refuse**. The option to reserve task sets is provided for Tolokers' convenience. If for some reason you can't complete the task sets you have reserved, it doesn't affect the availability of other projects or your performance in [Toloka](https://toloka.ai/tolokers/en/).

</Cut>

<Cut title="Questions about the content of projects">

<Cut title="The project contains adult content">

According to the [User Agreement](https://toloka.ai/tolokers/legal/user-agreement/), projects in Toloka may contain "adult" (including pornographic) content. Your actions in [Toloka](https://toloka.ai/tolokers/en/) that have to do with evaluating "adult content" don't violate the law. The Toloka service operates in accordance with the legislation of the Swiss Confederation and is aimed, among other things, at identifying materials of an offensive or pornographic nature. If this type of material is unacceptable to you, turn off the **I agree to perform projects that contain adult content** option in the profile.

</Cut>

<TroubleshootingContent3/>

</Cut>

<Cut title="Questions about a particular project">

Projects are posted and checked by requesters. If you have a question about the completion of a particular project, contact the requester directly. To do this, find the project in the **Available**, **Reserved**, or **Done** section, open the project, click on the three dots in the upper-right corner, and select **Contact requester**.

<TroubleshootingContent4/>

<TroubleshootingContent14/>

<Cut title="What should I do if I received a project that I do not want to complete?">

If you don't want to complete a project from the list, don't start doing it. If you started a project, but you can't or don't want to complete the page that opens, go to the next one (use the **Skip**) button. Only fully completed projects are paid for.

If you no longer want to complete this project, use the **Exit** button.

</Cut>

<TroubleshootingContent5/>

<Cut title="There are no projects in the list">

This happens because of the filters you set. Sometimes, Tolokers set up filters and then forget to disable them.

Make sure that:

- You chose at least one requester and at least one project category in the project feed.

- You specified the correct language in the profile.

- You linked your phone number to your [Yandex ID](https://passport.yandex.com/profile/phones).

- You are not connected via a server located in Switzerland (this may happen if you are using an [anonymizer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anonymizer), [VPN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_network) or [proxy server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_server)).

<Note mode="note" title="Note">

If you are willing to complete projects that are marked 18+, check that the **I agree to perform projects that contain adult content** option is turned on in your profile.

</Note>

If the problem persists, contact the [support service](../support?form-source=troubleshooting#contact) and attach:

- A screenshot of your profile in Toloka.

- A screenshot of the [Phone numbers](https://passport.yandex.com/profile/phones) page.

- Copied [technical information](https://yandex.com/internet/).

<Note mode="note" title="Note">

<Cut title="Questions about the mobile app">

<TroubleshootingContent7/>

<Cut title="How do I change the type of walk-home projects?">

Go to **Settings** by clicking on **More** in the lower-right corner, and switch the **Show map first after opening app** option.

</Cut>

<Cut title="How can I see all projects that are near me on the map?">

To see all projects located near you, switch to the project view mode on the map. You can do this by switching to the **Map** tab in the **All projects** section.

<Cut title="Technical issues">

<TroubleshootingContent9/>

<Cut title="I open the project, but there are no points on the map">

Project authors group task sets according to their goals. If you don't see any available projects in your city when trying to select points on the **All projects** tab, it means that there are no relevant projects in this group. To see all projects that are currently available in your city, switch to the project view mode on the map. To do this, switch to the **Map** tab.

</Cut>

<Cut title="After I click “Submit”, the project remains in “Completed”">

Check if the **Submit over Wi-Fi only** function is enabled in the app settings. If it is enabled, projects will be submitted once your device connects to Wi-Fi. You can disable this setting to submit projects via mobile Internet. If you connected to Wi-Fi, but the projects are still not submitted, open each project, go to the menu, and select **Send**.
