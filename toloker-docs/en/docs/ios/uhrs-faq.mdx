<Cut title="When will I get a bonus?">

When the session is closed, the bonus is calculated based on the number of completed projects. Within 24 hours, UHRS transfers money to Toloka account. These funds are initially unavailable for withdrawals as the projects undergo review. It might take up to 7 days. Withdrawal of funds will be available after the review period.

In the **Profile** section you can see two amounts of money of different colors:

- Gray sum shows the bonuses for projects that are under review;

- Black sum indicates funds available for withdrawal from Toloka.
