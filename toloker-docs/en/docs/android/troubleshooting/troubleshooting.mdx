# Troubleshooting

<Cut title="Problem with registration or login">

<Cut title="Questions about tasks">

<TroubleshootingContent13/>

<Cut title="How do I remove a reservation from a task?">

After the expiration of the allotted period, the reservation is automatically removed and the tasks return to the main page. You can remove the reservation manually. To do this, go to the task, click **←** and select **Refuse**. The option to reserve tasks is provided for Tolokers' convenience. If for some reason you can't complete the tasks you have reserved, it doesn't affect the availability of other tasks or your performance in [Toloka](http://toloka.yandex.com/).

</Cut>

<Cut title="Questions about the content of tasks">

<Cut title="The task contains adult content">

According to the [User Agreement](https://toloka.ai/tolokers/legal/user-agreement/), tasks in Toloka may contain "adult" (including pornographic) content. Your actions in [Toloka](http://toloka.yandex.com/) that have to do with evaluating "adult content" don't violate the law. The Toloka service operates in accordance with the legislation of the Swiss Confederation and is aimed, among other things, at identifying materials of an offensive or pornographic nature. If this type of material is unacceptable to you, turn off the **I agree to perform tasks that contain adult content** option in the profile.

</Cut>

<TroubleshootingContent3/>

</Cut>

<Cut title="Questions about a particular task">

Tasks are posted and checked by requesters. If you have a question about the completion of a particular task, contact the requester directly. To do this, find the task in the **Available**, **Reserved**, or **Done** section, open the task, click on the three dots in the upper-right corner, and select **Contact requester**.

<TroubleshootingContent4/>

</Cut>

<TroubleshootingContent14/>

<Cut title="What should I do if I received a task that I do not want to complete?">

If you don't want to complete a task from the list, don't start doing it. If you started a task, but you can't or don't want to complete the page that opens, go to the next one (use the **Skip**) button. Only fully completed tasks are paid for.

If you no longer want to complete this task, use the **Exit** button.

</Cut>

<TroubleshootingContent5/>

<Cut title="There are no tasks in the list">

This happens because of the filters you set. Sometimes, Tolokers set up filters and then forget to disable them.

Make sure that:

- You chose at least one requester and at least one task category in the task list.

- You specified the correct language in the profile.

- You linked your phone number to your [Yandex ID](https://passport.yandex.com/profile/phones).

- You are not connected via a server located in Switzerland (this may happen if you are using an [anonymizer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anonymizer), [VPN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_network) or [proxy server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_server)).

<Note mode="note" title="Note">

If you are willing to complete tasks that are marked 18+, check that the **I agree to perform tasks that contain adult content** option is turned on in your profile.

</Note>

If the problem persists, contact the [support service](../support?form-source=troubleshooting#contact) and attach:

- A screenshot of your profile in Toloka.

- A screenshot of the [Phone numbers](https://passport.yandex.com/profile/phones) page.

- Copied [technical information](https://yandex.com/internet/).

<Note mode="note" title="Note">

<Cut title="Questions about the mobile app">

<TroubleshootingContent7/>

<Cut title="How do I change the type of walk-home tasks?">

Go to **Settings** by clicking on three horizontal stripes in the upper-left corner, and switch the **Open tasks on map** option.

</Cut>

<Cut title="How can I see all tasks that are near me on the map?">

To see all tasks located near you, switch to the task view mode on the map. You can do this by clicking the blue button with the map icon in the bottom right section.

<Cut title="Technical issues">

<TroubleshootingContent9/>

<Cut title="I open the task, but there are no points on the map">

Task authors group tasks according to their goals. If you don't see any available tasks in your city when trying to select points on the **Available** tab, it means that there are no relevant tasks in this group. To see all tasks that are currently available in your city, switch to the task view mode on the map. To do this, click the blue button with the map icon at the bottom right tab.

</Cut>

<Cut title="After I click “Submit”, the task remains in “Completed”">

Check if the **Submit over Wi-Fi only** function is enabled in the app settings. If it is enabled, tasks will be submitted once your device connects to Wi-Fi. You can disable this setting to submit tasks via mobile Internet. If you connected to Wi-Fi, but the tasks are still not submitted, open each task, go to the menu, and select **Send**.
