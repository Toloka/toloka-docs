Skill levels allow the requester to offer projects to users who do a good job. The more skills you have and the higher your skill levels, the more projects you will have to choose from.

Requesters can set the price depending on the skill level. The higher your skill, the more money you will get for the project.

If you don't do well on a certain type of project, you may receive a low skill level. You will lose access to such projects.
