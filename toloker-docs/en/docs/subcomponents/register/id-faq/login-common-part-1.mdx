<Cut title="I can't register because my phone number is already linked to another account">

Your phone number can only be linked to one [Toloka](http://toloka.yandex.com/) account at a time. Most likely, you already registered in the system under a different username. Recall the username you registered with and use it to log in. If you don't remember your username, use [Restoring access](https://passport.yandex.com/passport?mode=restore).

According to the [User Agreement](https://toloka.ai/tolokers/legal/user-agreement/):

- The user may have only one account in Toloka.
- Re-registration is prohibited.
- The user must have a unique phone number.
