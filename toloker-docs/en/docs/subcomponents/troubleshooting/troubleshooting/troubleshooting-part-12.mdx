Under [How to be a successful Toloker](../../tasks), we describe the most frequent causes of bans and offer tips on how to prevent them.

If you get a ban, you will receive two messages:

1. An automated notification indicating the ban.

1. An administrator's message regarding the potential for unblocking.

If recalling the ban is possible, follow the instructions outlined in the message and await a decision, which typically takes several days to review.
