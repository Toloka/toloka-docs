<Cut title="Account blocked">

Toloka has an antifraud monitoring system. It automatically checks user behavior and blocks suspicious accounts. In different cases, the ban may be caused by different reasons.

Tips on how to avoid getting blocked are described under [How to be a successful Toloker](../tasks).

After blocking, you will receive two emails:

1. Automatic notification about blocking.

1. The message informs you why the account is blocked and if it is possible to unblock it.

If it is possible to unblock it, follow the steps in the email.
