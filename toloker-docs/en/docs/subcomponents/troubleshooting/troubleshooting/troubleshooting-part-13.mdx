<Cut title="What are free tasks for?">

Training tasks are generally not paid for. They are used to teach Tolokers to perform a particular kind of task and select those who show the best results. You get access to the main, paid task only after you successfully complete the training.

<Cut title="Low task cost">

The cost of the task directly depends on its complexity and how much time it takes to complete it. Simple tasks that don't require special skills and a lot of time cost less than more complex ones. But the better you cope with them, the higher their cost will be and the more chances there are to get a bonus from the requester.
