<Cut title="I can't click “Submit” when I complete training projects">

You must have made mistakes when completing the project, so you can't submit it.

How the training works:

1. You give responses to all projects on the page and click **Send**.

1. The system compares your responses with the correct answers provided by the requester.

1. If you make a mistake, a hint appears set against a red background.

1. Change your responses to the correct ones in all the projects where hints appeared.

1. Then click **Send**.

After you change all your responses to the correct ones, the training will be completed. If you think that you answered correctly, but the project is not accepted, take a screenshot of the page and send it to the author of the project.
