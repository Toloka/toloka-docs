Requesters check their projects before posting and try to make sure they don't contain malicious links. The virus can only appear if the content of the site you access from the project has changed after the project was posted. According to Section 4.7 of the [User Agreement](https://toloka.ai/tolokers/legal/user-agreement/), Toloka does not guarantee that projects won't contain viruses and other malicious components. When completing projects, the Toloker is solely responsible for the consequences of using the Toloka platform, including the damage that may be caused to software or hardware. If you encounter an infected site, notify the author of the project immediately.
