Requesters check their tasks before posting and try to make sure they don't contain malicious links. The virus can only appear if the content of the site you access from the task has changed after the task was posted. According to Section 4.7 of the [User Agreement](https://toloka.ai/tolokers/legal/user-agreement/), Toloka does not guarantee that tasks won't contain viruses and other malicious components. When completing tasks, the Toloker is solely responsible for the consequences of using the Toloka platform, including the damage that may be caused to software or hardware. If you encounter an infected site, notify the author of the task immediately.
