<Cut title="Tasks are not loading">

Try the following:

- [Clear](https://yandex.com/support/common/browsers-settings/cache.html) the browser cache.

- Disable antivirus and browser plugins, especially ad blockers and similar extensions.

- Check your browser settings and make sure that it doesn't restrict content loading (scripts, ads, and so on).

- Temporarily disable electronic signature software and extensions.

- Try opening [Toloka](http://toloka.yandex.com/) in a different browser.

<Note mode="note" title="Note">

You can also try opening [Toloka](http://toloka.yandex.com/) in Incognito mode. If you can open tasks in Incognito mode, it means that some extension is causing the error. If none of these methods help, contact the Toloka technical support.
