<Cut title="Questions about field projects">

<Cut title="Can a project be rejected if a person or a car license plate number is in the shot?">

When requesters review projects, they primarily check whether they are completed according to the instructions. However, according to Section 3.5 of the [User Agreement](https://toloka.ai/tolokers/legal/user-agreement/), you can't submit photos or videos of third parties or car license plates. Therefore, it doesn't matter whether the requester accepts the project or not. Your account might still be blocked for violation of the User Agreement, and you won't be able to withdraw money from Toloka (Section 8.5.3). Therefore, carefully check the photos and videos you're submitting for whether they contain vehicle number plates or other people's faces.

If the project asks you to take photos of strangers or car license plates, don't complete it and contact the Toloka support service. We will check the project, suspend it, or ask the requester to make changes to it so that the project complies with [Toloka](https://toloka.ai/tolokers/en/) rules.

<Cut title="I want to make a badge with the Yandex logo to complete field projects">

According to Section 5.8 of the [User Agreement](https://toloka.ai/tolokers/legal/user-agreement/), you work for Yandex as an independent contractor. Therefore, you can't use the logo, badge, or another ID that indicates your professional affiliation with Yandex or [Toloka](https://toloka.ai/tolokers/en/).

<Cut title="Why do I need to take photos in field projects?">

The photos you take help improve map services and make online maps and directories more complete, useful, and up-to-date.

<Cut title="What do I do if the employees of organizations ask questions or don't allow me to take photos?">

If the employees of organizations ask you what you're collecting information for, explain that you're completing a project on the [Toloka](https://toloka.ai/tolokers/en/) platform. Your goal is to verify information about a business's presence at a certain address and its working hours. The accuracy and reliability of this information is in the interests of the organization itself, because it will be published in directories and on online maps. If the employees of organizations tell you that you're filming illegally, explain that you're not collecting any personally identifiable information such as people's faces and car license plate numbers. All photos will be further processed according to all applicable privacy laws. If the employees of organizations don't allow you to enter the building and take photos, try to politely explain the legality of your actions. If this doesn't help, don't get into a conflict, and refuse the project.

<Cut title="I can't complete a project in a remote place">

<Cut title="There are no field projects">

The availability of field projects in specific cities depends on a number of factors: the needs of requesters, the epidemiological situation in the region, and so on. If there are currently no field projects in your city, it means that requesters have suspended their placement for some reason. Check the map from time to time. You'll see the projects when they appear.

<Cut title="I want to take a certain type of project, but it's not in the list anymore">

If the project you liked is no longer displayed, it may have already been completed or you don't meet the selection criteria set by the requester. While this project is absent, you can take other ones. The desired projects may appear again later.
