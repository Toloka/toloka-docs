# About the app

[Toloka](https://toloka.ai/tolokers/en/) is a crowdsourcing platform that helps process large amounts of data by distributing projects to a large pool of annotators (Tolokers).

Requesters post projects and set a price, while Tolokers choose projects, [complete](../tasks) them, and earn [money](../priemka#pay).

There are different types of projects available:

- Field projects. You get a point on the map that you need to go to and, for example, find an organization (such as a cafe or store), find their business hours, or take a photo.

- Regular projects. You don't need to go anywhere to complete them.

Completed task sets are [checked](../priemka) by the requester. The results are used to evaluate your [skills](../skills).

The prices are set by requesters. You can [withdraw funds](../pay/about) in different ways, depending on your country.
