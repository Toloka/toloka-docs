# API Toloka Apps external

`version: 0.12`

## Description

If you need to quickly solve a problem and you do not want to spend time on preparing a project, you can use the apps technology, which was specifically developed to ease the work with the platform.
Select the problem to solve and fill out an [application form](https://toloka.ai/talk-to-us/) for creating a project: the Toloka CSA team will configure the project for you, create a task interface, and the platform will find performers. All you have to do is prepare and upload your data, run the project, and get the labeling results.
To the Toloka customers, apps are available in the form of [bespoke solutions](https://toloka.ai/pricing).
