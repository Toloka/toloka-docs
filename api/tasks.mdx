# Overview

## Description {#description}

To upload tasks to a pool, you need to create JSON objects that contain:

- The input data for the tasks (such as text or image URLs).
- Correct responses (for control tasks).
- Hints (for training tasks).

Toloka automatically combines tasks into suites. You only need to specify the number of tasks to include in each suite (the `mixer_config` key in the [pool](/docs-new/api/pool)).

If you want to create the task suites yourself, follow the instructions in [Overview](/docs-new/api/task-suite).

## Methods {#methods}

Method | Endpoint | Overview
----- | ----- | -----
POST | [/tasks](/docs-new/api/create-task) | Creates one or multiple tasks.
POST | [/tasks](/docs-new/api/create-tasks-batch) | Creates multiple tasks.
GET | [/tasks/<task_id>](/docs-new/api/get-task) | Gets task data.
GET | [/tasks](/docs-new/api/get-tasks-list) | Gets the list of tasks in the pool.
PATCH | [/tasks/<task_id>](/docs-new/api/edit-task-overlap) | Changes the task overlap.
PATCH | [/tasks/<task_id>/set-overlap-or-min](/docs-new/api/set-min-task-overlap) | Stops assigning a task to Tolokers.

## Merging tasks {#task-merge}

<Note mode="restriction" title="Restriction">

- You can only merge tasks with identical input data. The order of fields in the JSON object must also match.

- You can only merge tasks in open pools. If a new pool got a task that was previously completed in a pool that has been closed or archived, the tasks won't be merged.

- You can only merge your general tasks.

</Note>

Merging saves you money if the same task was uploaded to different pools.

The response to the task received will be automatically assigned to another task if:

- Both tasks have the same input data.
- The tasks are located in different pools of the same project.
- An identical task is available to the Toloker responding.
- It has fewer responses than the overlap.

The response will be recorded with a zero price, and the overlap will be reduced by one.

This option is only available for general tasks without manual review that were uploaded using ["smart mixing"](/docs-new/guide/task_upload).

To activate task merging in a project, specify `"assignments_automerge_enabled": true` in the [project](/docs-new/api/project).
