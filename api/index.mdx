# Introduction

The Toloka API lets you create or delete projects, configure them as accurately as possible, and receive a list of these projects.

You can:

- Set up a [project](/docs-new/api/project) with a description of task settings (visual appearance, input fields, and so on).

- Create a [pool of tasks](/docs-new/api/pool).

- Define the logic for [selecting Tolokers](/docs-new/api/my-users) who will complete the tasks.

- Import [data for tasks](/docs-new/api/tasks) (image URLs, text, and so on).

- [Receive](/docs-new/api/result) and [review](/docs-new/api/accept) responses.

Requests are sent to the Toloka API over the HTTPS protocol. The service returns data in JSON format.

For debugging tasks, Toloka provides a testing environment — the [sandbox](https://sandbox.toloka.yandex.ru). Once you have tested the settings, you can use the project and pool in the production version of Toloka (the only thing you need to change is the [request URL and the OAuth token](/docs-new/api/access)).
