If you want to use the [majority vote](/docs-new/api/mv) quality control method, specify `MAJORITY_VOTE` in the [quality_control](#quality-control-popup) parameter. Some tasks are assigned with higher overlap (for example, "5") and checked. The rest of the tasks are assigned with the overlap set for the pool (for example, "1") and they are not checked. Selective review lets you improve pool completion quality.<br/><br/>You can reduce the frequency of checking tasks over time.<br/><br/>Example of settings: in the first 100 tasks completed by the Toloker in the pool, assign every 5th task with an overlap of "5" to check matching responses. In the following tasks, every 25th task is issued with an overlap of "5".
**quality_control. checkpoints_config. real_settings** | **object**<br/><br/>Selective review of general tasks. To make sure selective review is enabled, don't forget to set up task display in [mixer_config](#mixer_config).
**quality_control. checkpoints_config. golden_settings** | **object**<br/><br/>Selective review of control tasks. To make sure selective review is enabled, don't forget to set up display of this type of task in [mixer_config](#mixer_config).
**quality_control. checkpoints_config. training_settings** | **object**<br/><br/>Selective review of training tasks. To make sure selective review is enabled, don't forget to set up display of this type of task in [mixer_config](#mixer_config).
**speed_quality_balance** | **object**<br/><br/>[Speed/quality balance](https://toloka.ai/en/docs/guide/concepts/adjust).
**speed_quality_balance. type** | <CreatePoolTable9/>
**speed_quality_balance. percent** | **integer**<br/><br/>Percentage of Tolokers with the best task completion quality. The field is shown if the balance type is set to `TOP_PERCENTAGE_BY_QUALITY`. Possible values are 10, 20, 30, 40...100.
**speed_quality_balance. count** | **integer**<br/><br/>The number of active Tolokers the task is available to. The field is shown if the balance type is set to `BEST_CONCURRENT_USERS_BY_QUALITY`. May take a value from 1 to 100.
**dynamic_overlap_config** | **object**<br/><br/>Setting up dynamic overlap (also known as incremental relabeling or IRL). Allows you to change the overlap depending on how well the Tolokers handle the task.<br/><br/>Set the closing interval (`auto_close_after_complete_delay_seconds`). It should be enough to complete tasks with an overlap higher than the minimum.<br/><br/>When all pool tasks are completed, [aggregate the responses](/docs-new/api/aggregated-solutions).
**mixer_config. min_real_tasks_count** | **float**<br/><br/>Minimum number of general tasks in a task suite (if the number of assignments left is less than the number specified in `mixer_config.real_tasks_count`). MinimumÂ â€” 0. By default, the value is the same as in `mixer_config.real_tasks_count`.
**mixer_config. min_golden_tasks_count** | **integer**<br/><br/>Minimum number of control tasks per task suite (if the number of assignments left is less than the number specified in `mixer_config.golden_tasks_count`). MinimumÂ â€” 0. By default, the value is the same as in `mixer_config.golden_tasks_count`.
**mixer_config. min_training_tasks_count** | **integer**<br/><br/>Minimum number of training tasks per task suite (if the number of assignments left is less than the number specified in `mixer_config.golden_tasks_count`). MinimumÂ â€” 0. By default, the value is the same as in `mixer_config.training_tasks_count`.
**mixer_config. force_last_assignment** | <CreatePoolTable10/>
**mixer_config.force_last_assignment_delay_seconds** | **integer**<br/><br/>Waiting time (in seconds) after adding a task or increasing the overlap before assigning the last task suite in the pool. MinimumÂ â€” 0, maximumÂ â€” 86,400Â seconds (one day).<br/><br/>This parameter can be used if the pool has `force_last_assignment: true`.
**mixer_config.mix_tasks_in_creation_order** | <CreatePoolTable11/>
**mixer_config. shuffle_tasks_in_task_suite** | <CreatePoolTable12/>
**mixer_config.golden_task_distribution_function** | **object**<br/><br/>Vary the frequency of control tasks. The option allows you to change the frequency of checking as the Toloker completes more tasks.<br/><br/>If it is filled in, use `real_task_count` to specify the maximum number of tasks per task suite. To use the option, set the `golden_task_count:0` and `min_golden_tasks_count:null` parameter values.<br/><br/>The interval bound isÂ the number of a task in the pool. If the task suite has several intervals, the settings for the first interval are applied.<br/><br/>**Example:**<br/><br/>In the first task suite (the range from 1 to 25), every fifth task is a control task, and in the following suites, every 25th task is a control task.<br/><br/>**mixer_config.training_task_distribution_function** | **object**<br/><br/>Issue of training tasks with uneven frequency. This option allows you to change the frequency of training tasks as the Toloker completes more tasks.<br/><br/>If it is filled in, then in `real_task_count` specify the maximum number of tasks to put in a task suite. To use the option, set parameter values `training_task_count:0` and `min_training_tasks_count:null`.<br/><br/>**Example:**<br/><br/>
In the first task suite (the range from 1 to 25), every fifth task is a training task, and in the following suites, every 25thÂ task is a training task.

## Response {#response}

Contains information about the created training pool. Besides [parameters that are set when creating a training pool,](#pool-param) it includes parameters that are assigned to the pool automatically:

Parameter | Overview
----- | -----
**id** | **string**<br/><br/>Pool ID.
**status** | <CreatePoolTable13/>
**last_close_reason** | <CreatePoolTable14/>
**created** | **string**<br/><br/>The UTC date and time when the pool was created, in ISO 8601 format: `YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss[.sss]`.
**last_started** | **string**<br/><br/>The date and time when the pool was last started, in UTC in ISO 8601 format: `YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss[.sss]`.
**last_stopped** | **string**<br/><br/>The date and time when the pool was last stopped, in UTC in ISO 8601 format: `YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss[.sss]`.
**type** | **string**<br/><br/>Deprecated parameter.<br/><br/>Pool type. The value is always `REGULAR` indicating a normal pool.
