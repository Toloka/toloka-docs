**array of objects**

For training tasks. The Toloker's first responses in the training task (only if these were the wrong answers). If the Toloker answered correctly on the first try, the `first_declined_solution_attempt` array is omitted.

Arrays with the responses (`output_values`) are arranged in the same order as the task data in the `tasks` array.

```json
{
  "output_values": {
    "<field 1>": <response>,
    "<field 2>": <response>
...
    "<field N>": <response>
  },
...
}
```
